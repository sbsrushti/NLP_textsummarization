Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by Â£1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme.Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children.The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as "desperate", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children.The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: "These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters."She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers.But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be "crippled" by the move.
