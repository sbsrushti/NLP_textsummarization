A judge should look into the David Blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered, the Lib Dems say.Sir Alan Budd's inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover's nanny.But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems.Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying.Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up.But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.
