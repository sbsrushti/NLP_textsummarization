Edinburgh City Council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital.But Green MSP Mark Ballard fears people not on the council's edited electoral register may miss out.Local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters, such as the transport referendum.However, there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of February's voting deadline.The ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council's proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it.Towards the end of February, the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to Scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.
