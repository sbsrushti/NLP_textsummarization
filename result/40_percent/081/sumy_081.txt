The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID.The decision follows a "tough meeting" where some senior Tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the BBC.The bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary.Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected.Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.The new chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the "margins of society" would be driven into the hands of extremists.
