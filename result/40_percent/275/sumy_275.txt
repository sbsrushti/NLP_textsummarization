Labour and the Liberal Democrats say the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services.The Tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party's MPs that Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals.Tory backbencher Edward Leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the Financial Times: "I would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts."The Liberal Democrats launched their pre-election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the "authentic opposition", particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees.Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable also branded the Tory plans as "fantasy economics".Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a "fraudulent prospectus".The party on Tuesday challenged the Tories to publish the full report from David James, the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings.But the Tories are in turn demanding that Tony Blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.
