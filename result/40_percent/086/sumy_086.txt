Michael Howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.The controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election, where George Bush opposed extending it.But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Motor Neurone disease.Mr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research."Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind."With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older.But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems."Mr Howard acknowledged there were "no easy answers" over such an issue but it was necessary to "have the courage to do what we know to be morally right".Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident.Mr Howard made his remarks during a speech in Westminster to the Conservative National Women's Committee on ambitions and values.
