An artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany.She said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in Wales.It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don't think the government has the expertise.Shani Rhys James is worried that the Arts Council of Wales may be taken over by the Welsh Assembly Government."Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler's Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability."It was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control.The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.She told Good Morning Wales: "Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler's Germany, the actual quote I gave was: 'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'.The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government's umbrella.But she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.But Ms James, who won the Â£30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government.She has won a number of arts prizes including the Wales Open in 1989 and the Mostyn Open in 1991.
