An artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany.Shani Rhys James is worried that the Arts Council of Wales may be taken over by the Welsh Assembly Government.Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be "crass and ignorant" to liken a quango review to Hitler's Germany.The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.But Ms James, who won the Â£30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government.Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: "It's quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it's not like the health service and it's not like the railways.She told Good Morning Wales: "Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler's Germany, the actual quote I gave was: 'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'."As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression'."Artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.'""If you have the National Assembly taking control, I fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs.Responding to Ms James' criticisms, Mr Pugh said: "The structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly."Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler's Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability."
