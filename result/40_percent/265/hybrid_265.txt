Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.Six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than Â£4. Among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities.The plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing.Announcing the plans, Mr Redwood said: "Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made."The government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng attacked the Tory plans. "Cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police." The Liberal Democrats have said they would cut the number of Whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.
