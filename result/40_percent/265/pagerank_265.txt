The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.The government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive.Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive."The Conservatives are committed to cutting Labour's public spending plans by a massive Â£35 billion," he said."Labour are creating Two Britains: the Britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic Britain," he said."Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes.""Cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police."Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.
