Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS.The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching.Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia."It's very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.- People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a "high incidence TB country" will have to undergo a chest X-ray.- People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to "demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health".- They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to "impose significant costs or demands" on the NHS.And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: "TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well."Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: "This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives."Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one.""In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status," she said.
