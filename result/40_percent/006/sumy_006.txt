The initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed.More than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.The NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome."Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula," he said.But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal.NAO head Sir John Bourn said: "In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal."
