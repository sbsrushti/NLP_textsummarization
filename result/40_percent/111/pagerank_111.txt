UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been "straightforward" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would "deliver better" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party.Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'," he said.Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his decision to quit UKIP at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week.UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he was glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly.It's all flash and no real policy here  Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.And he announced the party would be holding a leadership election.Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a "firm but fair" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election."While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not," he said.Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk has said he wants to "change the face of British politics" as he launched his new party.The party asserts that Mr Hockney "has a moral obligation, if not a legal one" to stand down.Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities.Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had "gone AWOL" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer.Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!
