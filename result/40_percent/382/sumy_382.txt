The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election.All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.People coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching.Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB.The Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health.However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.They claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas.They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk.Home Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries.Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick.Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were "in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it".
