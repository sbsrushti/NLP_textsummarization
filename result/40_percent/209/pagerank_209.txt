The Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting "a 100% effort" to end the violence, Mr Abbas added.In an interview ahead of a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, Mr Abbas said such attacks were against Palestinian interests.A spokesman for Mr Blair said the Prime Minister expected the conference to discuss "a comprehensive, co-ordinated and, above all, practical work plan for both the Palestinian Authority and the international community".British foreign minister Jack Straw said there had been a "continuing stream" of information suggesting Palestinian militant groups were operating from within Syria.The conference was a "vital step" in renewing the peace process, Mr Straw said.In an email interview in the British newspaper the Independent, Mr Abbas said: "We believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with Israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy."Mr Abbas confirmed Israel shared information with the PA in the hunt for the organisers of the attack.
