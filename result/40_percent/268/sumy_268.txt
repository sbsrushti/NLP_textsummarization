Labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins a third term in power, the party's election chief Alan Milburn has said."What we want is for more people to earn and own," Mr Milburn told BBC Radio 4's Today show.Tory Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin called Labour "a brilliant machine for talking about things" but said it did not deliver policies the country needs.Mr Milburn told Today that Labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in Britain.Pressed on incapacity benefits, he said the tax and welfare system must "provide the right incentives to people".Mr Milburn also sought to draw a line under the controversy about reports of a feud between Gordon Brown and Prime Minister Tony Blair.In the speech, he backed choice in schools and hospitals, wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system."Our task is to rebuild the New Labour coalition around 'one nation politics' that recognise, while life is hard for many, all should have the chance to succeed," he said.Voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the 1960s, he also told his audience.Oliver Letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services, such as cleaner hospitals, discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets.For the Lib Dems, Simon Hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldn't be tuition fees and more debt "have been given exactly the opposite".
