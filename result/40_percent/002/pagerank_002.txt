The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was "too unlikely to have been a coincidence", Mr Beith said.All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the "e-mail regime" could "support the freedom of information regime".Richard Thomas "totally condemned" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January.The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.Mr Thomas said: "The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence."The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year.Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said.
