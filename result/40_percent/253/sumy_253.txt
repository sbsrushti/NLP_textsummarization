Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.Mr Blair said the claims were "reheated from six months ago" and that he was concentrating on running the country.The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had "mutual animosity and contempt" for each other.It claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party.And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down.But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book."I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: "When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you.Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of "squabbling like schoolboys".He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton: "This is the politics of the playground and Britain really does deserve better.""Either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election."During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a "big role" at the general election.
