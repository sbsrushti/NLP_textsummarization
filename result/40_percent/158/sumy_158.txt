Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the Commons on Thursday.Mr Brown told the House that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments.He said: "It is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.The RAC welcomed the news, calling it an "early Christmas present" for motorists."We are concerned that although Britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action," said a spokesman.The chancellor did not raise duty that year, but despite threats of more protests in 2003, he added 1.28p per litre.
