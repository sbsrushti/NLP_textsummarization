Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament's environment committee. The evidence is part of the committee's inquiry into the impact of climate change in Scotland. Experts studying the seas off Scotland's west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month. Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands and Southampton have been looking at wave heights in the Atlantic over the last nine years. The project was conducted jointly by the Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Millennium Institute network, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre. Scientists carried out a series of studies, including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the Hebrides.
