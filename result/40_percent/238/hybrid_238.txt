A regiments' campaign group is to target nine marginal Labour seats at the General Election. The campaigners unveiled a huge poster featuring Black Watch soldiers fighting the war in Iraq before they announced their election plans. The group said it is well organised, with 350 volunteers, and will be announcing at least one other candidate later. It added that it can only be stopped from inflicting serious damage on Labour if the government reverses its plan to merge the six Scottish regiments.Scotland's only Conservative MP Peter Duncan said the Save the Scottish Regiments had done a "superb job" in fighting against defence cuts. He added: "Their actions have reflected the pride that most people in this country have in our troops, and have shown a steely determination to make Labour pay for their betrayal. However, Labour MP George Foulkes said the campaigners would not make any difference to the outcome of the election and would not win the argument. As well as their election move, Save the Scottish Regiments will join other campaigners at a rally in London in the spring.
