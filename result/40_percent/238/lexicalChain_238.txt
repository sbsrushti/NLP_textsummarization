Save the Scottish Regiments will also field a candidate against Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram in East Kilbride. The marginals are Aberdeen South, Dumfriesshire, Dundee East and West, South West Edinburgh, Ochil, Stirling, East Renfrewshire and Western Isles. The campaigners unveiled a huge poster featuring Black Watch soldiers fighting the war in Iraq before they announced their election plans. Scotland's only Conservative MP Peter Duncan said the Save the Scottish Regiments had done a "superb job" in fighting against defence cuts. He added: "Their actions have reflected the pride that most people in this country have in our troops, and have shown a steely determination to make Labour pay for their betrayal. " Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said it had received a "big boost" from the campaign's decision to endorse SNP candidates in four marginal seats. However, Labour MP George Foulkes said the campaigners would not make any difference to the outcome of the election and would not win the argument. As well as their election move, Save the Scottish Regiments will join other campaigners at a rally in London in the spring.
