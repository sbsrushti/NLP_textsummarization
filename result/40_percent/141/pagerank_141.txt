Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary.Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives".Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme.Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and "deeply flawed".He said: "This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards."But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans "stink".Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a "regressive" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would "set out the position very clearly" when he stands up to debate the matter next week.And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected.He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration.
