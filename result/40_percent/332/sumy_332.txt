Labour's election chief Alan Milburn has defended his party's campaign posters amid Tory claims the ads were nothing short of "sly anti-Semitism".He was responding to Tory spokesman Julian Lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party.A row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin, and as a flying pig, amid claims they were anti-Semitic.The posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election.In the Commons, Tory spokesman Mr Lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded MPs that Labour chairman Ian McCartney last year described shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin as a "21st Century Fagin"."Given the outrage that that smear caused then, how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-Semitism?""I fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the Labour Party website."
