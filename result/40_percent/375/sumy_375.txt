Gordon Brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £120,000 as he put the economy at the heart of Labour's election campaign.Mr Brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until September.Tory leader Michael Howard predicted the Budget would do nothing to help Labour's "faltering" election campaign."This government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems Britain faces," Mr Howard told MPs.Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.During his 49 minute speech Mr Brown told MPs he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.He said his Budget struck a balance "between tax cuts that are affordable, investments that are essential and stability that is paramount".The child tax credit will rise in line with earnings, giving families an extra £5 a week.He also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago.BBC political editor Andrew Marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters.Other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to boost low cost home ownership.Mr Brown said he had met his financial "golden rule" with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.Some 12,500 civil servant posts have been axed, and 7,800 relocated out of the south east of England, he added.SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Brown had failed the "tartan test" as there were no measures to boost the Scottish economy.UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed "more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want," not "free bus rides".
