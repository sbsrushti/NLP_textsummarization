The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and "very clear", Alun Michael has said.The rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not.Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a "massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting".People had turned out "to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed "legally" as far as he was aware.Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal.Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: "There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities.He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed "gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes".Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police.
