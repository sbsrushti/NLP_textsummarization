People had turned out "to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed "legally" as far as he was aware.Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken.But Mr Jackson, who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.Some 270 hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds.The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and "very clear", Alun Michael has said.He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts.Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: "There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.If people tried to "run circles around this law" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said.You can't hunt accidentally.""If people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear.
