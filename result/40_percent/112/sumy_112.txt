A majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over David Blunkett's involvement in a visa application, a poll suggests.But nearly half those surveyed said Mr Blunkett should return to Cabinet if Labour won the next election.Some 63% of respondents in the Sunday Times poll thought his former lover - Kimberly Quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign.Mr Blunkett resigned as Home Secretary on Wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by Mrs Quinn's former nanny had been speeded up.Sir Alan Budd's inquiry also found Mr Blunkett's account of events had been wrong.A second poll for the Independent on Sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the Blunkett controversy.Some 82% said Mr Blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his, but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming.Thirty per cent said the affair showed Mr Blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%, disagreed.
