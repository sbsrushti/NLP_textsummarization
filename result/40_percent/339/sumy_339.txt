The Liberal Democrats have unveiled plans to build 100,000 new "affordable" homes on publicly owned land.The Lib Dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites.All the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after a survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford a home in 92% of UK towns.The Lib Dems say their "mutual homes" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs.Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government.There are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities.The kind of "golden share" used by the Lib Dems in South Shropshire could be rolled out more widely.But the plans involve changing the VAT system, which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings."This is typical of Lib Dem hypocrisy," said Tory shadow local government secretary Caroline Spelman.Housing Minister Keith Hill said much of the Lib Dem plans mimicked the government's strategy.Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labour's promise to spend Â£42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.
