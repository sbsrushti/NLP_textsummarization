The party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder.The Lib Dems say their "mutual homes" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs.It would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account.Labour has said it will allow 300,000 council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes.There are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities.Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labour's promise to spend Â£42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.Instead, they are sold at "build cost" to people who the local council decides have local needs."They claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder, but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market."Housing Minister Keith Hill said much of the Lib Dem plans mimicked the government's strategy.Mr Kennedy said: "Mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually, investing only as much as they can afford."The flagship Tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes.
