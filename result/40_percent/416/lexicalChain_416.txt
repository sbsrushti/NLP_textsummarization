The Liberal Democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top Tories - including leader Michael Howard - at the next general election. Others targeted include Oliver Letwin, David Davis and Theresa May, Lib Dem's elections chief Lord Rennard said. In 2001, Michael Howard won the Folkestone & Hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907. "I just don't think Labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a Conservative. " He denied this strategy was opportunism, insisting the Lib Dem's policies on issues such as tuition fees, the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed "to all sides of the political spectrum". The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies.
