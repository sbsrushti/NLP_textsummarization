Mr Cook, who is giving evidence to the Power inquiry into voter turnout rates, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme it was not fair to blame the public who were "more interested in politics than ever before".The government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.His comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts.He, like Mr Kennedy, pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the Iraq war.Voters' "pent up passion" could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election, Charles Kennedy has said.Ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of "pager politics" and not being heard.
