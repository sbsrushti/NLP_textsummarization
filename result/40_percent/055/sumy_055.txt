Teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a "zero tolerance" drive, Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has suggested.Ms Kelly told the BBC progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems.The minister also confirmed she received "spiritual support" from the Catholic movement Opus Dei."We have made huge progress on the really difficult cases, the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.It is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes.Ms Kelly entered the Cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then Home Secretary David Blunkett.Critics say the organisation, which adheres strictly to Catholic teachings, is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims.Asked if she was a member of the group, Ms Kelly said: "I do have spiritual support from Opus Dei and that is right.She categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister.The government has yet to issue its official response to the Tomlinson review, which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma."Ruth Kelly wants to ditch the Tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place," he said.
