Violent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing, the trade and industry secretary has said.She is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include "high levels of violence".Parents are expected to spend millions on video games as Christmas presents.His mother, Giselle, said her son's killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game.Police investigating the Stefan's murder dismissed its influence and Manhunt was not part of its legal case.The government is holding a further meeting on Friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the British Board of Film Classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer.It is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors."We need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement."Her call was backed by Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Tessa Jowell who said: "You wouldn't let your child watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.It's the same principle - adults can make their own informed choices, but children can't always and need to be protected."
