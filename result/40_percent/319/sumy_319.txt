A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected.The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the Lords.But the all-party group, including Tories Ken Clarke and Sir George Young, Labour's Robin Cook and Tony Wright and Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a "large majority".The group says the British public and a clear majority of MPs support replacing the Lords with a largely-elected second chamber.Mr Cook said holding elections for MSCPs on the same day as those for MPs might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout.He added: "Over the last year I have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice.The group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable.Mr Clarke said the issue "went to the heart of reforming the health of the British political system".And Mr Tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the Lords was flawed."We believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny," said co-ordinator Peter Facey.
