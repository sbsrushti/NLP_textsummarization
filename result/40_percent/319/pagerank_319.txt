A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.The group says the British public and a clear majority of MPs support replacing the Lords with a largely-elected second chamber.The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected.The Elect the Lords Campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate.Their plan would see the House of Lords being renamed the Second Chamber of Parliament, and its members would be known as MSCPs.And Mr Tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the Lords was flawed.But the all-party group, including Tories Ken Clarke and Sir George Young, Labour's Robin Cook and Tony Wright and Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a "large majority".The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries.There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the Lords in Labour's manifesto.Tony Blair has argued."The problem, I think, in the prime minister's mind is there doesn't appear to be a consensus that includes him," he said.
