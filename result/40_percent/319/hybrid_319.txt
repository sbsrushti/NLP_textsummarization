A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the Lords. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the Lords in Labour's manifesto. The group says the British public and a clear majority of MPs support replacing the Lords with a largely-elected second chamber. Their plan would see the House of Lords being renamed the Second Chamber of Parliament, and its members would be known as MSCPs. He added: "Over the last year I have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice. Mr Clarke said the issue "went to the heart of reforming the health of the British political system". And Mr Tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the Lords was flawed. "The problem, I think, in the prime minister's mind is there doesn't appear to be a consensus that includes him," he said. The Elect the Lords Campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate.
