The National Correctional Agency would have provided a 'one-stop' justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition.The plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison, preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.However, following a consultation on the idea, Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson has decided to drop the plans.Instead, Ms Jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.She will announce the move in her Criminal Justice Plan on Monday, aiming to "break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community".The new measures will place a new statutory duty on the SPS to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships.A national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise Ms Jamieson on the SPS's role and performance in reducing reoffending.The minister said: "Better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there.
