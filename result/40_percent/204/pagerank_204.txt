The Scottish Executive will not now merge the Scottish Prison Service with local authority social work criminal justice departments.Ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments, which provide community sentences, might have provided an answer.Instead, Scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending.She will announce the move in her Criminal Justice Plan on Monday, aiming to "break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community"."Communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better.The minister said: "Better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there."It costs the taxpayer Â£35,000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing.The National Correctional Agency would have provided a 'one-stop' justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition.
