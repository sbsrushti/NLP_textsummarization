Millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders.The Cabinet Office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action.It is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a "career average" salary.Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May.In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it was reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon.On Monday, Tony Blair's official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans.Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal."Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away," he said."What really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of MPs who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in Europe, but say they can't afford it for anyone else.Mr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government.The Fire Brigades Union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions.
