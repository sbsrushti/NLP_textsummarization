Pressure was placed on staff to be efficient, rather than to do a thorough examination of an application, the Public Accounts Committee found. MPs want research into whether UK visa holders leave at the end of their stays, or vanish into the black market.

Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian "entrepreneurs". He added "that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre-entry applications will be replaced by a single pre-entry check at post, which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system".
