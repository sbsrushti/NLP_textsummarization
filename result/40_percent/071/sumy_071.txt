MPs want research into whether UK visa holders leave at the end of their stays, or vanish into the black market.Committee chairman Edward Leigh said: "There is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued."Entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. "The committee's report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year.Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused.Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian "entrepreneurs".
