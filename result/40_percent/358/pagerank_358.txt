Mr Straw said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.Britain's Â£3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's European Council summit, Jack Straw said.The foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with Turkey about possible EU membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to "see the light" on the rebate.The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the Commission wants it to be 1.26%.
