Britain's Â£3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's European Council summit, Jack Straw said.The foreign secretary told MPs the rebate, secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, was "entirely justified".New European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the EU budget.Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to "see the light" on the rebate.He added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the UK's stance - Britain contributed more and received less than other EU states.The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the Commission wants it to be 1.26%.
