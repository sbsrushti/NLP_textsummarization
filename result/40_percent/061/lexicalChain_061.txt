Hundreds of ballot papers for the regional assembly referendum in the North East have "disappeared". Royal Mail says it is investigating the situation, which has meant about 300 homes in County Durham are not receiving voting packs. A spokesman for Darlington Council said: "We have sent out the ballot papers, the problem is with Royal Mail. "A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: "We are investigating a problem with the delivery route in the Mowden area of Darlington. "The Darlington Council spokesman added: "Initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in Mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now. " A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission told BBC News Online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected. She said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time.
