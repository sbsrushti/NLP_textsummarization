David Blunkett has been accused of using the "politics of confusion" to disguise new EU immigration measures. Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain. The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK. The home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his Tory opposite number Mr Davis. "By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto. " On Monday Tony Blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of British borders. He accused the government of being "pathetic" when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of "surrendering" on the issue. And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over. Mr Blair told his monthly news conference Britain had the "best of both worlds" and would keep the veto.
