And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over.Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.He accused the government of being "pathetic" when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of "surrendering" on the issue.He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK."If we don't like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people," he said.David Blunkett has been accused of using the "politics of confusion" to disguise new EU immigration measures.Mr Blunkett met his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue."By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto."Under this scheme larger states such as Britain are expected to have more power than the smaller EU states.Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain.
