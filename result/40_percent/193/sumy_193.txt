Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain.The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states.He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK.The home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his Tory opposite number Mr Davis.And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over."With the Treaty of Amsterdam seven years ago, we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe."Mr Blunkett met his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.The 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy, in favour of the qualified majority voting (QMV) system.Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a European asylum solution."The Liberal Democrats have long argued that Britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it's right that we don't do this in isolation."
