UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been "straightforward" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead."He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'," he said.Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!I think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point.Good luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP's party list.Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue.Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would "deliver better" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party.Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done.Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.It's all flash and no real policy here  Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe."While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not," he said.Whatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England.Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a "firm but fair" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in "lies and spin", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend.So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat.Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities.UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.The electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had "gone AWOL" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy.The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name?Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer.A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly.As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating.If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to "change the face of British politics" as he launched his new party.Hopefully the UKIP members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.The party asserts that Mr Hockney "has a moral obligation, if not a legal one" to stand down.Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP.UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.There is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive 'Eurosceptic' argument.Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not.I've always thought that Kilroy-Silk was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes.This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.If every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long!He took a party that was just building up a head of steam, and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d'etat, he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two.He has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the European Parliament.
