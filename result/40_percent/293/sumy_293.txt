Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to "change the face of British politics" as he launched his new party.Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said "our country" was being "stolen from us" by mass immigration.He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for "truth" - would avoid the old parties' "lies and spin".UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a "firm but fair" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining "an already crowded field on the right of British politics".On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat.He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had "gone AWOL" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly.The party asserts that Mr Hockney "has a moral obligation, if not a legal one" to stand down.UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been "straightforward" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in "lies and spin", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend.It really is time that the UK government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue.In addition as an Ashfield constituent I would be more than interested in Kilroy -Silk opposing Geoff Hoon!Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe.We benefit enormously from our membership of the EU, we need to be at the heart of Europe, leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go, not running away from it.This new party might gain support from right-wing England, but will have little impact in Wales or Scotland.England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the USA forever!The interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people's bickering that who, in the overall scheme of things, really cares about their petty tiff?You may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating.Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.Hopefully the UKIP members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.The Conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-Europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local, European and general elections.He took a party that was just building up a head of steam, and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d'etat, he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two.The closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as I am concerned, but in any eventuality, the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.If every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long!The EU's comments last week about Michael Howard's plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the EU and not individual member states.British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.As one of Kilroy-Silk's East Midlands constituents I hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity.UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.Someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of UKIP's democratic nature.They will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed, more democratic, more dynamic Europe Union.Good luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.The man I once found cringe worthy on Day time TV, could well turn out to be my country's knight in shining armour.What's more, I look forward to the day when he claims victory, wrecks the EU, and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP.Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes.If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes.But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not?The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?
