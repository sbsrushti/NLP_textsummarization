Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday.The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair.They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties.The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments.Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely.The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.
