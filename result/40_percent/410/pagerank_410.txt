Mr Sayeed has been MP for Mid-Bedfordshire since 1997.After the vote, Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election.But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him, with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes.Mr Sayeed had denied the claims, saying the suspension was "unjust and wrong" but he made an "unreserved" apology to MPs in the Commons chamber.Mr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen "well below the standards expected".The decision comes after Mr Sayeed survived an attempt to de-select him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of Parliament.
