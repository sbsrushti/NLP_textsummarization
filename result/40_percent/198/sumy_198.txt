A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.However, Norfolk police chief Andy Hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed.His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the government's plans be put on hold.Andy Hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 February.He said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation.But aspects such as transport, and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account.Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended the Licensing Act, saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in Europe because of a "tiny minority" of violent binge drinkers.A six-month transitional period starts on 7 February during which time venues can apply for extended licences.Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "It would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours."Chief constable Mr Hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems."If you come to Norwich on a Friday or Saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed.
