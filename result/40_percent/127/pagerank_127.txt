Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.Next year will be "make or break" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added.Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years.Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005.Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption.They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations.The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Brown's speech on Wednesday."That is why next year is a test," he said.Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a "scar" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic.But 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable.
