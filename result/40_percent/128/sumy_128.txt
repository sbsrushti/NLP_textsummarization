Gordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.In an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met.The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK "industrial history" but denied he was "gloating".But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown "Sir Wastealot".The shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's "golden rule" had "turned to dross in his hands" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn.Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices."There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt.Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers.Mr Brown's insistence he was not "gloating" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson.Taken together, the measures would create a "welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history", said Mr Brown.He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance.Mr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt "low and sustainable" - both in this economic cycle and the next.Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics.Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation.
