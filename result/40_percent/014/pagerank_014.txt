Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be "far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through".The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday.The Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November.The government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already.I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months."The bill proposes "control orders", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.The Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest.Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords.
