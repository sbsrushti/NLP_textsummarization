The UK's top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen.Lord Woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence.Lord Woolf, who is Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, was giving evidence to the Commons public administration select committee's inquiry into public inquiries.Judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue, such as the intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, he said.He argued: "The subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved.He told the MPs: "Anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me."The issue had been "overlooked" when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions."What I am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn't happen," he said."Their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence - a very narrow dispute, in Lord Woolf's words," she said."Judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs."Parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries.
