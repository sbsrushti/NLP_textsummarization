Scientists have expressed concerns that new education secretary Ruth Kelly's religious views could hamper vital scientific research.Medical Research Council Professor Nancy Rothwell said Ms Kelly's views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists.Professor Rothwell, who is also vice-president of research at Manchester University, told the Times Higher Education Supplement it would worry her "a great deal" if ministers were anti-stem cell.Head of developmental genetics at the National Institute of Medical Research, Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, said he had witnessed the confused situation in the US where many religious groups opposed the practice.He said: "If someone as senior as Ruth Kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country.But fertility expert Lord Winston said he thought it was "rather good" ministers held ethical views.Concerns have also been raised by "pro-choice" organisations that Ms Kelly's views might affect sex education policy in schools.Family Planning Association chief executive, Anne Weyman, said teaching pupils about contraception and abortion were key.Currently, individual schools devise their own sex education policies based on a framework provided by the DfES.Ms Kelly has not set out her detailed views on either issue yet, but has said she intends to put parents first in education policy.
