Medical Research Council Professor Nancy Rothwell said Ms Kelly's views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists.Ms Kelly has not set out her detailed views on either issue yet, but has said she intends to put parents first in education policy.Concerns have also been raised by "pro-choice" organisations that Ms Kelly's views might affect sex education policy in schools.It was down to the Higher Education Funding Council and the research councils to decide on universities' research allocations.But she added that claims Ms Kelly was in charge of a Â£1bn university research budget were not true.Professor Rothwell, who is also vice-president of research at Manchester University, told the Times Higher Education Supplement it would worry her "a great deal" if ministers were anti-stem cell.Scientists have expressed concerns that new education secretary Ruth Kelly's religious views could hamper vital scientific research.He said: "If someone as senior as Ruth Kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country."You can't have a higher education policy that is at odds with the government's science policy.""Young people must be informed about all the issues within sexual health, which include contraception and abortion.
