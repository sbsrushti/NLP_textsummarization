Tony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.The prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974.He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster.In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved "to be completely and publicly exonerated".The families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons.However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology.Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would "ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them".Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son.Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends.Mr Conlon's case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.
