Thousands of civil servants were on strike across Wales on Friday in protest at planned job cuts. The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales. Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham. Gordon Brown issued a defiant statement about the strike, saying the action would not affect the government's "determination" to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare, education, transport and the fight against crime. " The UK-wide action hit Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices and driving test centres. PCS Union spokesman Jeff Evans said: "In Wales the civil service is major employer, there are more civil servants employed in Wales proportionately than in any other part of the country. "Parts of Objective One areas and Welsh-speaking areas will be particularly affected by these cuts. Piers Freelove is senior benefit officer on the picket line at Companies House, in Cardiff. "I joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension, as we thought, and pay, and it's those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs. " PCSU deputy general secretary Hugh Lanning, who was on the same picket line, said: "We're asking for them to negotiate not just to make announcements. " The Welsh Assembly Government said: "This is a strike about national civil service issues.
