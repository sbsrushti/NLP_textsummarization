Mr Blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to Mrs Quinn's two-year-old son.The interview with BBC Radio Sheffield was made before allegations he fast-tracked a visa for Mrs Quinn's nanny.In an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son, he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences, even when they were painful.Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio Sheffield: "I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story.BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary.Shadow home secretary David Davis says Mr Blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly.Reports have claimed Mr Blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny Leoncia Casalme's wait.Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she hoped Mr Blunkett would survive in his job.
