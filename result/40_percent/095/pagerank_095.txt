But the chancellor said Mr Baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge.What the chancellor wanted was "not by any means what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see", Mr Baume said.He also said that as Mr Baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge.Number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a "soap opera" about Mr Blair and Mr Brown.Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of "competing agendas" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair.It suited the purpose of Mr Baume's union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the Treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government.
