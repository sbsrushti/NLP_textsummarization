Gordon Brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair was harming the workings of government.He said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members' jobs.It suited the purpose of Mr Baume's union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Under the plans, unveiled in the Gershon report, some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services.He also said that as Mr Baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge.On Wednesday, ahead of the Chancellor's pre-Budget report, Mr Baume told BBC News there were sometimes "conflicting and competing agendas for government" between Number 10 and the Treasury."Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the Treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government."The problem is that on many occasions these two don't add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle."
