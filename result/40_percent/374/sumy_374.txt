A major change of direction is needed in Britain if it is to prosper, the shadow chancellor said as the Tory Party spring conference began.Tory co-chairman Liam Fox had opened the forum in Brighton with an attack on Labour's record and party leader Michael Howard is due to speak later.Mr Letwin said voting for Labour meant choosing higher taxes, borrowing and waste.He also attacked the government's "failure" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS, telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime.A Tory government would sort out the "shambles" of immigration, put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools, he said.His welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in London to lead the party's opposition to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in its lengthy progress through Parliament.Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year.
