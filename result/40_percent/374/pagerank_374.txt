Tory co-chairman Liam Fox had opened the forum in Brighton with an attack on Labour's record and party leader Michael Howard is due to speak later.Oliver Letwin said the UK could not compete with other countries without the Â£4bn tax cuts he was promising.Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year.But Mr Letwin said Britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league."Can this country compete, can this country prosper, unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy?""If we are going to take on the great challenges, the challenges like those posed by the Chinese and the Indians, we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax," he said.he said.
