The e-University was scrapped last year, having attracted only 900 students at a cost of £50m.Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: "UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money.The Commons education select committee called this "morally indefensible" but the government said the e-University project had "improved understanding".With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had "too much freedom to spend public money as it wished", the report found.Chief executive John Beaumont was paid a bonus of £44,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers.She added: "UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom."
