A failed government scheme to offer UK university courses online has been branded a "disgraceful waste" by MPs.Chief executive John Beaumont was paid a bonus of £44,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers.The Commons education select committee called this "morally indefensible" but the government said the e-University project had "improved understanding".Initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least £110m in profit.With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had "too much freedom to spend public money as it wished", the report found."The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme."The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but "should learn the lessons from this disaster".
