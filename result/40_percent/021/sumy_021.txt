Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the "cornerstone" of Labour's programme.In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months "a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term".In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year.Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: "He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. We're not so sure."David Page, of Investec Securities, said: "His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of Â£8bn is way too optimistic.Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using "fancy statistics" to hide public service failures.Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his "golden rule"."It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending," Mr Cable told MPs.
