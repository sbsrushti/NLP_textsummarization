Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution.Mr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005.Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw.EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand.He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent "where it adds most value".Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was "fully justified".Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued."Isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?," he asked.Mr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about Â£2,500 to design, print and deliver.Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a "level playing field" on immigration and asylum controls.
