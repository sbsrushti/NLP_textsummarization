Tony Blair has said he will not take part in a TV debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election."We answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons I have given before, the answer is no," he said at his monthly news conference. In recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate, although it has never happened. Televised debates have become the high point of the US presidential election campaigns.
