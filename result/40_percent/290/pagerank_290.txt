The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests.If the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed.Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.The people who Mr Forsyth labels the new "threat" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam.Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/  I agree with Mr Forsyth.The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government.Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it.The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK.I agree with Mr Forsyth's views.Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth.But in the 66 years that I have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us.)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides.Mr Forsyth links "Islamic fundamentalism" to the new "threat".I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-Qaeda tyranny.Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.The government is seeking to introduce a police state.I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as Mr. Forsythe's opening comments suggest.Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.The terrorists have already won.The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy.To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny.Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people.It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler.That goes right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they "knew best".Frederick Forsyth puts it beautifully.I agree with Frederick Forsyth.I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him.Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs.We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat.It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked.This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.The government are faced with an incredibly difficult task, and have made a policy to deal with it.This puts it on a par with the government of Burma.I don't usually have much time for Mr Forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same.If the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next?An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth.People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair.Terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom.If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any.It is based and funded abroad; so was the IRA.(apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?).But history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power.My whole generation was blighted by it.The threat now is new.The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing.As a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not.The terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately.The evidence of any real terrorist capability in the UK is scant.Forsyth is wrong.The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government.Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.Yes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth's views.It has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the IRA.Our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces, you have to be shown to be deserving of it.Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism.It is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so was the IRA.Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq.You cannot compare the threats of past years with now.However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.The nature of the current threat is new.Let's hope the BBC doesn't get gagged for letting people express their views.That was why the tyrants lost.By the early seventies it was terrorism as well.These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence.But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tells BBC News of his personal response to the move.I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.Some pretended it was not there.I believe what this government is doing, is, at the very least, highly questionable and at worst, sinister.When ID cards become mandatory, the data collected will not be protected by the Data Protection Act, and will be readily available to people like GCHQ, with no control by the person whose ID is being checked.If individuals are treated in the same distorted way, then we've done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs.The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of.After all, today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you!Whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive, it is, unfortunately, also the first step towards totalitarianism.
