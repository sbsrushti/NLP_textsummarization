Tony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said."Britain is heading in the wrong direction", the Conservative leader said in his New Year message. Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster. The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to "turn these beliefs into reality" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain. "Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system."Mr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the "wrong solution" to them. "We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential." This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account." "Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.
