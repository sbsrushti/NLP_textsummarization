Tony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said.But Labour's campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: "Britain is working, don't let the Tories wreck it again".Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster.Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to "turn these beliefs into reality" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain."The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice."Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.""We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account."Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax.Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.
