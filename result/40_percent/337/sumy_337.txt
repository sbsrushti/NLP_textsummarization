Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing "cold calls".The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls.The information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept.Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies.A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers.Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them."If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned," said Mr Jones.Earlier, Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor wrote to the watchdog saying: "The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are "significant" numbers of such calls."I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases," he tells the commissioner.
