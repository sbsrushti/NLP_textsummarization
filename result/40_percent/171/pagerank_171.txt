The Tories say Labour's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed."We aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the UK."The extra coaching would be funded by the National Lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school.Shadow sports minister Lord Moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy.The Tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities, only £41m had been spent.
