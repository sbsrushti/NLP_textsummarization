Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced.Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible.However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found.About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.Ms Hodge said: "Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society.The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principle with the government's plans.Tony Hunter, the organisation's president, said: "There are many devils and lots of details hidden within the Government's proposals.
