Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using "grossly disproportionate" force could be prosecuted.The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law.Instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves.Mr Howard said the "grossly disproportionate" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders.The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm.But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars.Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said.Tory MP Patrick Mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in Parliament on Wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.
