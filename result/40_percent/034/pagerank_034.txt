But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars.On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.He said: "The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir John Stevens was making and the prime minister was making."Mr Howard said the "grossly disproportionate" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using "grossly disproportionate" force could be prosecuted.The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rules were "weighted overwhelmingly" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke.Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: "It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.
