Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.In a statement, it said: "The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war.Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead.Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: "I've lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim.He said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002.He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.Mr Mubanga and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp.Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview.And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga's transfer to Guantanamo.Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam.
