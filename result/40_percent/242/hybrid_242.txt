Civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents, figures compiled by the Tories suggest.Some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the Freedom of Information Act's implementation on 1 January. The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years. But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins.Liberal Democrat Alan Beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the Department of Constitutional Affairs - said if the claims were true, Whitehall was "acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act". "Both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny." Dr Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records". It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.
