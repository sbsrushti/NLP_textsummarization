Civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents, figures compiled by the Tories suggest.Some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the Freedom of Information Act's implementation on 1 January.Departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records.The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years.But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins.Fellow Lib Dem Norman Baker said the episode painted an "unflattering picture of the inner workings of government".Dr Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers.The number of files destroyed by the Ministry of Defence and the departments of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Trade and Industry has also risen dramatically.Earlier this week, Mr Thomas said he was looking into Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.
