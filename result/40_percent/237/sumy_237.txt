Ex-chatshow host Robert Kilroy-Silk has attacked UK policy on immigration saying Britain's open door approach is hitting low wage "indigenous" workers.The Veritas leader said the only people to benefit from immigrants from places like Poland were employers, landlords, members of the 'metropolitan elite'.He said Veritas wanted to grant an amnesty for all those in Britain claiming asylum and who have children and deport everyone else.Britain should take its fair share of asylum seekers under the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, he argued.
