Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12. The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was "fundamentally flawed" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a Â£100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be "radical reform".The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of Â£500. The Tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland. They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a "ceiling" on what the richest pay.
