The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland.Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a "ceiling" on what the richest pay.A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made.They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down.Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of £500.The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was "fundamentally flawed" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.
