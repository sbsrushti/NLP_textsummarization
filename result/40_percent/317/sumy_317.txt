Anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.Pensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase.Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be "radical reform".A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made.An independent inquiry into its findings, the Lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005.The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement.Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of Â£500.The Lib Dems say their plan is fairer, more efficient, has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.
