The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented "a formidable force" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election.Opposition to raising the retirement age is "one thing all the unions are agreed on", our correspondent added.The Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions.There was "some possibility" of the strike action being avoided, he added.
