The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers.PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented "a formidable force" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election.A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.Opposition to raising the retirement age is "one thing all the unions are agreed on", our correspondent added.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night.
