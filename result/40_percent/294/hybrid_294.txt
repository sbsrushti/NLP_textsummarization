The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system."For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice," he said. "If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop." BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented "a formidable force" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election.Opposition to raising the retirement age is "one thing all the unions are agreed on", our correspondent added. Our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations.
