Council tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.Authorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.

On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.
