 It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference. "It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country." The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.
