A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200.The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.There were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m.It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly.The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions."The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."
