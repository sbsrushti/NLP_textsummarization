London mayor Ken Livingstone has again refused to retract a Nazi insult made to a Jewish reporter.Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is "standing by" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a "concentration camp guard".At his weekly press conference on Tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise.On Tuesday, the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly.Two motions were passed by the London Assembly, which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor's activities, on Monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments.The mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of "examples of intrusion by journalists" into his, and his family's private life."I don't suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the Holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history.It has the power to suspended or bar him from office but Mr Livingstone said: "There must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years."Because if I do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers."On tape Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking reporter Oliver Finegold if he is a "German war criminal".Mr Finegold replies: "No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal.
