The UK has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other's efforts, a report claims.Essential Guide to British Quangos 2005 author Dan Lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since Labour won power in 1997.He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department.Conservative deregulation spokesman John Redwood said: "The research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos, and slimming down the rest.Lib Dem spokesman Ed Davey meanwhile said instead of the "bonfire of quangos" New Labour had promised, there had been an "explosion" of them."Liberal Democrats would abolish many, merge others, and make any that remain properly accountable."The quango guide follows last year's government-commissioned Gershon Report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.Mr Lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £1.8bn a year - cash he says which "appears to be almost entirely wasted".And he argued it was "absurd" to charge farmers for Agricultural Wages Committees, which set working and wage standards in the industry, when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £1 an hour.It says before a new public body is set up, an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.
