Essential Guide to British Quangos 2005 author Dan Lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since Labour won power in 1997.Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato Council, set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets, "surprising".They were the British Potato Council, the Milk Development Council, the Energy Savings Trust, Agricultural Wages Committees, the Wine Standards Board, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council.He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department.Mr Lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost Â£1.8bn a year - cash he says which "appears to be almost entirely wasted".The UK has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other's efforts, a report claims.The quango guide follows last year's government-commissioned Gershon Report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.Mr Lewis asked.The report is published by the Efficiency in Government Unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the Economic Research Council and the Centre for Policy Studies.
