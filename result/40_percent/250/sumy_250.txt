A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.Here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected Spring poll.Once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well.But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around.Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.He said the UK had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.That the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs.Various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing.We don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out.We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.We are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action.Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time.When the ban comes into force on 18 February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid.(Rural affairs minister) Alun Michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult.Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face.People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad.The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting.We will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting.We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK.We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum.Choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade.It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that.We will invite the opinion formers, MPs, journalists and others.The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers.Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about Â£750.If fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified.There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and I would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations.Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press.
