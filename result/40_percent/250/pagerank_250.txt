A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice.It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that.Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that.But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around.If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.We will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press.We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK.The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum.Before 1997 most pensioners voted Conservative.We've called for the state pension to be increased from £79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £105.45.Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.It will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face.People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad.He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.Fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers.Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools.We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority.The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.When the ban comes into force on 18 February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid.It's exactly what the prime minister did not want.It is hard to say whether we will be successful.I think we will be successful.We are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking.With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.If fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified.
