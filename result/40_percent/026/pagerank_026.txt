The Commission for Africa's report will be released on 11 March - Comic Relief day, Tony Blair has said.The former rock star's presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands.Bob Geldof, in characteristically blunt style, promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for Africa.As well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in Africa.The announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer Bob Geldof - in London.
