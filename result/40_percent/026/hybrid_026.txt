July's G8 summit in Gleneagles in Perthshire - chaired by the prime minister - will use the report as the basis for talks on Africa. The announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer Bob Geldof - in London. Mr Blair told a news conference: "It will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality, but I hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there."Mr Blair has vowed to put Africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the G8. The former rock star's presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands.
