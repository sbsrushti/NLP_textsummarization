Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out.He pointed to Tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing, strengthen company pensions and encourage savings.A survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds.For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%."Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."The report was welcomed by Conservative shadow pensions secretary David Willetts."Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives," Mr Lishman said.In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections.
