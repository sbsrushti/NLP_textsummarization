Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.A survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds.Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out.He also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to "support us all in an ageing society"."Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote."In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections."Labour's continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government."Labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to Incapacity Benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system.
