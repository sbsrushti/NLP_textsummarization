The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescott's department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced.The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low."Irreversible environmental damage" will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned.Conservative local government spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said: "There is now growing evidence that John Prescott's buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural England."Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee Peter Ainsworth MP, said: "The government's housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial.- The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain.Points raised in the report included:   - No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence.
