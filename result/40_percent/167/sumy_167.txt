"Irreversible environmental damage" will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned.Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced.He said: "We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment."The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low.The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescott's department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said.- The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain.- The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities.Conservative local government spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said: "There is now growing evidence that John Prescott's buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural England."
