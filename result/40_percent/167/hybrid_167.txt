"Irreversible environmental damage" will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned."Sustainable communities" were being promoted without a real understanding of what "sustainable" means, the Environmental Audit Committee said."The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low. "I accept the need to improve housing supply but, as things stand, the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers, with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser." Points raised in the report included: - No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence.  - The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain.  - Measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes.  Conservative local government spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said: "There is now growing evidence that John Prescott's buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural England.
