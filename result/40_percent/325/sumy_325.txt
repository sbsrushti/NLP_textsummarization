Damian Hockney, now Veritas deputy leader, and Peter Hulme-Cross were elected in 2004 on the list system.UKIP chairman Petrina Holdsworth urged the men to step down from the GLA in a letter."We would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done, to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election."He accused the party of signing up to a deal with the Tories in Europe, rather than sticking to an independent stance.But the claim was denied by UKIP spokesman, who said: "Mr Hockney's accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty."Veritas was formed by Mr Kilroy-Silk earlier this month after he quit UKIP following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.
