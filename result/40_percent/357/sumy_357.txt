Gordon Brown reallocated Â£512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-Budget report on Thursday.Mr Raynsford said he had held some "pretty frank discussions" with fellow ministers over the plans.But he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises.Mr Raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities.Ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without "unreasonable council tax increases", he added.Mr Raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.He insisted the changes were "very modest" and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring "very early".But general secretary of the public services union Unison Dave Prentis criticised the plans.
