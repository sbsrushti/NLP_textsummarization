Welsh councils should set their taxes at "reasonable levels" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.Finance Minister Sue Essex said it was a "good deal" for local government.The £3.2bn settlement includes the "full" £7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown.But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises.The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that "significant" cuts to services may still be unavoidable.After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed."It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase."On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds."I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties."Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement "hugely disappointing".Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding.But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty."Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change "is taking spin to the very verge of deception".He added: "Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures."
