But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in "rushing" anti-terrorism legislation.BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords, where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties.Mr Blair told the BBC the "control orders" would only be used in the most limited circumstances.An explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons.She said the legislation was "a travesty and a perversion of justice" and would remain "unpalatable" even if a judge was involved early in the process.On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders.Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue.Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders.Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: "We are being advised by the police and the security services... "What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt.
