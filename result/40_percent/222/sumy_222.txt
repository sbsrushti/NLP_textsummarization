British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow.The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006.Ballot papers in the poll will ask: "Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?"Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU."If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe," said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled.
