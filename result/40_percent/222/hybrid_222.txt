British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006.Ballot papers in the poll will ask: "Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union." The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a "yes" vote. But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as "two separate issues".
