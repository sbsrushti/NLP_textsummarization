British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.The Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour.The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006.The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week."If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe," said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled.Ballot papers in the poll will ask: "Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?"
