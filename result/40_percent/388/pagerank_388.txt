Elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.The Tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives.They also want to set up a new "half-way house" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that "individual budget".Ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes.There are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050.But Age Concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice.He ruled out free personal care in England - which is on offer in Scotland and Wales, saying it was "unsustainable".The government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been "disappointing".Monday's consultation paper on social care for adults in England is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency.The Lib Dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over Â£100,000.
