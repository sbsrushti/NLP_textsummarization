A government-commissioned study ranked the UK third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ICT).The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online.The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.Mr O'Brien said: "The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring."It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years."The government would play its part in "cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish", Mr O'Brien said.
