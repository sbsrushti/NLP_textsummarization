 The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online.It showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. Mr O'Brien said: "The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring. The "clear message" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business."However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy," he added.
