The papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a "Baghdad bounce" following successful Iraq elections in January. Harold Wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second electionThe latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a February poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over Conservative leader Michael Howard. The papers report that Alan Milburn, Labour's head of elections strategy, has played a key role in the plan for a February election, which would include a New Year advertising blitz.
