Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election.But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers.UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views.Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be "made available to law-abiding members of the community" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade."The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate.Peter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night.
