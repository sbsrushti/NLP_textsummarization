Peter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night.Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: "I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway."He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate.UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views.Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers.He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party.Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be "made available to law-abiding members of the community" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade.
