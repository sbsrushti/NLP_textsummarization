Moves to lift the European Union's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet.He expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. "The code of conduct is much more effective, it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China," he said. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries. The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban.Mr Ancram argued: "What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted. "It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong.
