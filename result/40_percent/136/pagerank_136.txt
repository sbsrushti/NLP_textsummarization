Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries.The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said.Mr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten.UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban.Mr Ancram argued: "What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... "It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong."The 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.Moves to lift the European Union's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4's World At One."The code of conduct is much more effective, it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China," he said.
