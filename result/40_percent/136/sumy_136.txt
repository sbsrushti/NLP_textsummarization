Moves to lift the European Union's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban.Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: "This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square.Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4's World At One.In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said."The code of conduct is much more effective, it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China," he said.Mr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten.Mr Ancram argued: "What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... "It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong."Mr Straw's China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers.He will meet Chinese counterpart Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries, Hong Kong and China's part in the talks on North Korea.
