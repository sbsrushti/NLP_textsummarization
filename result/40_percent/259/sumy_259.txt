Vote For Me - ITV1's Pop Idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.Over the next four days, hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote."Any of them would make competent MPs," former independent MP Martin Bell insisted on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Mr Bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on Wednesday, argues that Westminster has its share of "odd balls" and the show will engage ordinary voters.But Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of "corrupting politics".To give Sir Bernard his dues, Monday evening's opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists.Among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels.Among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on Bruce Forsyth's birthday and Bill Oddie for prime minister.The show follows the time-honoured Pop Idol format, with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.They were then cross-examined by the panel, which was chaired by ex-ITN political editor John Sergeant, with television host Lorraine Kelly taking the Nicki Chapman role.But the real star of the show is Kelvin MacKenzie, in the Simon Cowell, Mr Nasty seat.Mr Lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes.Mr MacKenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress.The series continues throughout the week, with the public given the chance to evict one prospective MP every night.
