Pensioners are being promised energy savings by the Liberal Democrats, as snow and cold temperatures continue.The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation.The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes.The plan would boost energy conservation, says the party - and insulation could save Â£100 every year for pensioner households, so using the money more "intelligently" than at present.
