Tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election, declaring Britain needs "a change at the top". Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair's record in government. He also attacked the government's "failure" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS, telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. BBC political correspondent Shaun Ley says opinion polls suggest the Tories still lag some way behind Labour on the issues of health, education and the economy. Conservative leader Michael Howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech.
