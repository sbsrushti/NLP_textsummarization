Support is being sought for a bill which would ensure that large retailers in Scotland remain closed on Christmas Day and 1 January.MSP Karen Whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season.Ms Whitefield said: "I have found members of the public to be very supportive when I have been campaigning on the streets."The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family."The consultation on a Christmas & New Year's Day Trading Bill has so far attracted almost 500 responses and closes on 7 February.
