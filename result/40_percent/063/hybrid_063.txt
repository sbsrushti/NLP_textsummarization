 MSP Karen Whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season. Ms Whitefield said: "I have found members of the public to be very supportive when I have been campaigning on the streets."The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family." Usdaw general secretary John Hannett added: "Christmas Day and New Year's Day are special days for everyone in Scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special. "We want people to tell Karen, through her consultation, whether they want the special nature of these days to remain, or whether they want them to become like any other trading day, with shops open for business as usual.
