UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.It comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. Deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in Belmarsh Prison in London under the current laws introduced after the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001.Under the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.British citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects.Mr Clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in "serious" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.He said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources' lives at risk. "So unless the process is clearly just, the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists." He suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court. He said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be "very high indeed" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. She said: "Adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse.
