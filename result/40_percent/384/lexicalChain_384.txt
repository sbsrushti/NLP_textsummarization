UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary. Deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in Belmarsh Prison in London under the current laws introduced after the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001. Mr Clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan without them facing torture or death. Under the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet. Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith said the plans were a "further abuse of human rights in Britain". Mr Clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in "serious" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges. " He accepted the law lords' ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. He said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources' lives at risk. " He suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court. He said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be "very high indeed" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. Shami Chakrabarti, from human rights group Liberty, joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials.
