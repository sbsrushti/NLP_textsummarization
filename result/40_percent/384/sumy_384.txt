UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.It comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights.Charles Clarke's planned "control orders" mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest, curfews or tagging.Deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in Belmarsh Prison in London under the current laws introduced after the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001.Mr Clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan without them facing torture or death.British citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects.Mr Clarke also said intelligence reports showed some British nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats.He accepted the law lords' ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists.Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis was worried about extending special powers to cover British citizens.He said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be "very high indeed" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws.Shami Chakrabarti, from human rights group Liberty, joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials.
