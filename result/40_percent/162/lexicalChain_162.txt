The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said. The TUC figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue. General secretary Brendan Barber said: "It shouldn't be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. "Rory O' Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: "Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. "Death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century. " The TUC has called on the government to appoint "roving" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections.
