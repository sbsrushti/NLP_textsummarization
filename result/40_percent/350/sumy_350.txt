Gordon Brown has delivered a rousing speech to Labour's spring conference setting out the government's agenda for the next general election."Mr Brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the Asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade," our correspondent said.On Friday night, Mr Brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the Labour manifesto had been published after the Budget, expected in March.But commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether, as the Conservatives claim, he plans to raise tax after the election.Following the chancellor's keynote speech, the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on Saturday.Mr Blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected May election.The prime minister's enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed, Alan Milburn, Labour's election strategist told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.Starting in London, he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were Labour's achievements on the economy, crime, education and public services.The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the pledges - set to underpin Labour's election campaign - were "worthless".
