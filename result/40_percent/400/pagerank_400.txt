When Britain went to the polls in 1979, Tory leader Margaret Thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory, and Lord Callaghan resigned as Labour leader.Former Labour prime minister Lord Callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday."It was not a major surprise - I knew what a blow the death of his wife Audrey was a few days ago," he said.He held each of the major offices of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became Lord Callaghan of Cardiff in 1987.Lord Callaghan, who leaves a son and two daughters, was the longest living former British PM in history.Conservative peer Lord Heseltine said that despite their political differences, he and Lord Callaghan became friends.Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said: "When I was first elected in 1983 as the youngest MP, he was the "Father of the House" and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in Parliament.His political career was not without controversy.Former cabinet colleague Lord Hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was "immense sadness"."It was a commitment to public service that brought Jim Callaghan into Parliament in 1945, and while Jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots."In the autumn of 1978, before the "Winter of Discontent" when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill, Lord Callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a Labour victory."He was always full of warmth and wisdom."His political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party.As foreign secretary in the early 1970s, Lord Callaghan kept an open mind about the UK's entry into the Common Market, seeing the advantages of the UK's entry.
