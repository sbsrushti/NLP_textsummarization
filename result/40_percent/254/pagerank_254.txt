Lord Haskins even suggested Mr Blair should reinstate Mr Brown as the central figure in the election planning.For his part, Mr Brown insists his only motivation was to get Labour re-elected.And Mr Brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year.Tony Blair will seek to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at Westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which Gordon Brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.And it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and Westminster gossip.Gordon Brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign.Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.They believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears.Mr Blair talked about the "New" Labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label.Then there are the actions of the men themselves.For example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick.Ian Gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: "For goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can."There are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation.Either way, there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the Labour party serious damage.
