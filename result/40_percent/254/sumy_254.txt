Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.Along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues, they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of Britain.Ian Gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: "For goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can."Meanwhile the likes of Health Secretary John Reid and Labour peer Lord Haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue.But this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage.And it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and Westminster gossip.Even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories, they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.Mr Blair talked about the "New" Labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label.And Mr Brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year.The trouble is, both men have fallen short of offering simple, straightforward denials of the central claims.One only had to listen to the chancellor's friend and former spin chief Charlie Whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister's apparent attempts to confound Mr Brown's leadership ambitions.It is no secret in Westminster, for example, that Downing Street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.The prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor.Meanwhile large numbers of backbench MPs insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter, which they believe is a media-only obsession, or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry.
