Detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the UK's highest court has ruled.The ruling creates a major problem for Charles Clarke on his first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation.The Liberal Democrats say Mr Clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor, David Blunkett.Belmarsh prison has been dubbed Britain's Guantanamo Bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws.The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge."It deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford."In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: "I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."Ben Emmerson QC, representing seven of the detainees, said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years.When the men were first held, they took their cases to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).The commission ruled on 30 July, 2002 that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as British people could not be held in the same way.But that ruling was later overturned by the Court of Appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.
