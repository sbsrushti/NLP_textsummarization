Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was "fractured, divided and uncertain", Mr Blair said.Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an "umbilical cord" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.Mr Bush's first task was to "rebuild a sense of domestic purpose" within the US, he said.Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most "pressing political challenge" of the present day, Mr Blair warned.Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his "warmest congratulations", saying: "We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom."The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added.Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election "a true celebration of American democracy".Mr Kennedy said: "Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism."
