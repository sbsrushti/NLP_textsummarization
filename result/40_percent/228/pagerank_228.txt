Labour said the poster was "not anti-Jewish, but anti-Tory".A Labour spokesman denied the campaign was anti-Semitic.The Labour Party has been accused of anti-Semitism over a poster depicting Michael Howard and Oliver Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.The campaign was particularly insensitive as it had come out at the same time as Holocaust Day, a "difficult" time for many Jewish people, Mr Mennear added.He said there was nothing more distasteful for a Jewish person than to be associated with a pig."As we said at the time the James report (the Tory backed inquiry into possible public spending savings) was published pigs will fly before the Tory's sums will add up.The poster shows the two men's faces superimposed on winged pigs and says "the day the Tory sums add up".
