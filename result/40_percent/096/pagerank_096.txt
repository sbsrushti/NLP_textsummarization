Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers.The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said.Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the "great unfairness" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England.The Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was "consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom" if the assembly was scrapped.Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.The changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.
