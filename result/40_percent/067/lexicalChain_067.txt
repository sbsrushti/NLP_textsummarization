Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. Other plans include: - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past  - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases  - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet  - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a "medium range" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: "Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that. " Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals "lacked compulsion". " Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were "inadequate" and were "papering over the cracks of the current system". She said a Conservative government would bring a "radical reform" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a "legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation". The government says children cannot simply be divided up "like property" when a marriage collapses.
