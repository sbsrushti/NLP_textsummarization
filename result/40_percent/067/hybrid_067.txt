 Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. He denied fathers' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC "there is a recognition that something is wrong". But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include: - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past  - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases  - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet  - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.  Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a "nuclear option" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said." Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published "in the next two weeks," a spokesman said."We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is." Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were "inadequate" and were "papering over the cracks of the current system". She said a Conservative government would bring a "radical reform" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a "legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation". "We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort," she added.
