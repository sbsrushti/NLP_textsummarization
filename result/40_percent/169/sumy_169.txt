The new law banning hunting with dogs is "so poorly drafted" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say.The accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to "chase away unwanted animals" from his farm.Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, Defra.The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free.Tory MP Peter Luff, another co-chairman of Middle Way, said that the legislation was "so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence".Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: "There is no confusion, it is a matter of simple common sense."If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.
