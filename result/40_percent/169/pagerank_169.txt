Mr Opik said: "Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act."If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defra's lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was "not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence".He had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the Hunting Act.Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain.The new law banning hunting with dogs is "so poorly drafted" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say.North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, Defra."If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting."
