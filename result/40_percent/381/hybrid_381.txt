Support for a ban on hunting has fallen in the past six years, a poll suggests.Less than half the UK wants a ban compared to almost two-thirds in 1999, the Mori survey of 2,000 adults for BBC One's Countryfile programme suggests. Most city-dwellers support the ban but rural people were evenly split between supporters, opponents and undecided. In July 1999 they asked 801 adults if they supported the ban for the Mail on Sunday. But the programme makers suggest the British public are becoming "increasingly neutral" to the issue because around one quarter said they "neither support nor oppose" a ban.
