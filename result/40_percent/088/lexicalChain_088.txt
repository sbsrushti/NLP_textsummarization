The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. The information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but there is a "grey" area if personal data is kept. But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications. The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. " A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. " Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: "The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal. " He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are "significant" numbers of such calls.
