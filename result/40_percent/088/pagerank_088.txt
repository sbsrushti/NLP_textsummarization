A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future.The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising."If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing," he said."When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not," he said.He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are "significant" numbers of such calls.A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers.But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls.Political parties are aware of the regulations.Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.
