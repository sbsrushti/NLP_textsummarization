Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing "cold calls".The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls.The information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but there is a "grey" area if personal data is kept.Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies.A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers.A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: "The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are "significant" numbers of such calls."I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases," he tells the commissioner.Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.
