Record numbers of schools across the UK are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government.Some 600 schools have already signed up for the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005 run by the Hansard Society and aimed at boosting interest in politics.Pupils in the schools taking part will learn the skills of speech writers, canvassers and political candidates."The mock elections initiative provides an opportunity for pupils to develop their own understanding of how the democratic process works and why it matters."By experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future."Information packs, including ballot papers and manifesto guides, with elections happening in early May were sent out to the 3,000 schools invited to take part.
