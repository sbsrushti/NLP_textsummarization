The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002.It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event.For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton.The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort.
