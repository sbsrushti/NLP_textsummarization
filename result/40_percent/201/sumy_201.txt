Tory leader Michael Howard has dismissed claims that his immigration policy was "moving onto the turf" of the British National Party (BNP).But Mr Howard said he rejected the idea that the Tories and BNP appealed to the same voting instincts.He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "If you want good community relations in this country...then you have to have firm, fair immigration controls."Labour has unveiled its own "points system" for ensuring migrants who want to work in the UK have skills that are required, but have rejected immigration quotas.Mr Griffin told the Independent the Tories' plans were "a definite move onto our turf".He said: "I quite freely accept that on a nationwide basis, the Tories will con enough people to make a significant hole in our vote."Asked whether he was comfortable with the perception that the Conservatives and the BNP appeal to the same voting instincts, Mr Howard told the BBC: "I reject that entirely".He said he found BNP's policies "abhorrent" but he said the UK had to take a different approach to immigration, which he said was out of control.
