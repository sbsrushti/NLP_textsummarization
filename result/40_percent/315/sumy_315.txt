The head of the "failing" Child Support Agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation.Doug Smith's departure was announced by Work Secretary Alan Johnson on 17 November as MPs grilled him over the agency's poor performance.Mr Smith's departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the Child Support Agency.It now emerges that the widespread belief Mr Smith, made Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year honours, had left, was wrong.A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman confirmed Mr Smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found.Tory work and pensions spokesman David Willetts said families affected by CSA failings would wonder why Mr Smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced.The CSA has been surrounded by controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.The work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was still building up.The MPs found American IT giant EDS' Â£456m system was "nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate".He added his committee was "duty bound" to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the CSA and it would be "premature" to say anything further on the issue at the moment.He added that he had been absolutely open when he announced Mr Smith's departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a "different thing"."The major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure we've got the right people," he added.
