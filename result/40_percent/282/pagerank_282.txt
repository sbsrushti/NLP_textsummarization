Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of "misrepresenting" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans.Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in "wasteful" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts.In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts.Mr Blair said: "The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.Mr Brown warned that the Tories were planning "the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto".Mr Blair added: "They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.""Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?"The prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure.Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be "distracted or diverted".Mr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party.
