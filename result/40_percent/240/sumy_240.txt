A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.It followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport, such as that done using the internet and mobile phones, has led to more cheating.The all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting.They include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years.Lord Condon, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, who originally made the call for longer prison sentences, said the two-year penalty was "derisory"."You could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports.The panel's aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating, assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right.
