As well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting, there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves.The report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up "audit trails" - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced.Lord Faulkner of Worcester, who chaired the inquiry, said: "Whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters, the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption."You could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports.The Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year.Betting exchanges allow punters to back (to win) but also lay (to lose) a horse.
