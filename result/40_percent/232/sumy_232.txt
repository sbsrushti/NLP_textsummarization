An investigation by the Standards Board is under way following allegations that Ken Livingstone has brought his office into disrepute.The probe follows the London mayor's comments to a Jewish journalist comparing him to a concentration camp guard, after a party about a week ago.The local government watchdog also said the allegation related to a failure to respect others.A complaint was made to the body by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Commission for Racial Equality.Speaking after the investigation was announced Bob Neill, leader of the London Assembly Conservatives, said: "He has behaved in a manner unbecoming of his office and in so doing, has shown extraordinarily poor civic leadership.The Prime Minister Tony Blair is among those who have called for an apology but so far the mayor has refused.The mayor accused Oliver Finegold, of the Evening Standard newspaper, of "doorstepping" him at a "predominately gay event" held for MP Chris Smith.Ms Gavron said she thought Mr Livingstone's comments were "inappropriate" but she did not believe the mayor was anti-Semitic.
