 The survey findings are being released to coincide with the launch of the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005 initiative. "Mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters," he said. The Y Vote initiative is being run jointly by the Electoral Commission, the Hansard Society and the Department for Education and Skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election, possibly on 5 May. Michael Rafferty, who is mock elections project manager at the Hansard Society, said he looked forward to seeing schools and colleges across the UK participating in the mock votes.
