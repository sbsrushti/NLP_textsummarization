The majority of young people are interested in politics, holding "strong opinions" on policies and have a "keen appetite" for direct action.Research undertaken for voting watchdog the Electoral Commission suggests 81% of 16 to 20-year-olds feel strongly about issues like crime and education.Electoral Commission boss Sam Younger said: "We know that young people often feel disengaged from democratic life and we believe in working creatively to encourage their interest and participation."Mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters," he said.
