Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.Mr Howard said the authorities were not "providing the local accountability that we want to see" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a "minimum policing guarantee" with their chief constables.Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace "inconspicuous" police authorities.A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary."The commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
