Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.Responding to the plans, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained."The commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Mr Howard said the authorities were not "providing the local accountability that we want to see" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.Critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community.Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and "could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials".A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary.Other Tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.
