Lord Falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years.New targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament.Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence.The plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses.Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday.Ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice.Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this.
