New targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.Ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice.Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs' plan, Lord Falconer said: "One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims."Courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant."Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence."But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it's not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them."The plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses.Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday.Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament.
