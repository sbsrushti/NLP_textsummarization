Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was "out of control" during the "wild" 1960s. Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as "Precious" at school. Despite being told he was a "nutter who died at sea" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: "I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones," said the Ealing North MP. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: "The earth went from under my feet. We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection.
