It was a different time - it was pretty wild."I was 18 when she was conceived.Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as "Precious" at school.I was pretty much out of control.Mr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: "I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead."Despite being told he was a "nutter who died at sea" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited.He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a "set-up" but he then realised all the dates fitted."It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending.
