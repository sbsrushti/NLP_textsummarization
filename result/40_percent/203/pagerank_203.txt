But Mr Leigh said the department was "dragging its heels".The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks.A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's "lackadaisical" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak."Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and Â£40m of invoices remain unpaid," Mr Leigh said.National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at.Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed.He also said Defra had been "dreadfully slow" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.
