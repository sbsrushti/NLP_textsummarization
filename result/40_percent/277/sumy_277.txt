The premier was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget.Mr Blair derided Tory claims they could cut Â£35bn in "wasteful spending" saying the party had got its sums wrong.Mr Howard told MPs that "every independent expert" from the International Monetary Fund to the Institute of Fiscal Studies had suggested the "government was spending more than it is raising and a Labour chancellor would have to put up taxes".Mr Blair replied: "I think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the Treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right."The Liberal Democrats have also launched their pre-election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the "authentic opposition", particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees.Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a "fraudulent prospectus".
