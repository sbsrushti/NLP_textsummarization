The men's solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture.The Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.The government has written to two of the British men freed from Guantanamo Bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture.Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001.But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy "condemns and prohibits" torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused.It is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976.This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said.
