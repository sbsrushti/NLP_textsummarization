Tony Blair has pledged to "never, ever, ever" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.The prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: "If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically."One poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs.Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.Others compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist.Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: "The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous.Mr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day.The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper.Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard.He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.
