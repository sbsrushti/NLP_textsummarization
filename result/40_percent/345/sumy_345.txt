In a written statement, Constitutional Affairs Minister Christopher Leslie said the current minimum age of 21 for an MP would be reduced to 18.The announcement from Mr Leslie - who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe Tory seat - prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16.The voting age affects millions of younger people," said spokesman Alex Folkes."We would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age."Irish republican Bernadette Devlin was one of just a handful of 21-year-olds elected to Parliament in the 20th century winning a seat in 1969.But the youngest is understood to have been Tory Edward Turnour, who won the 1904 Horsham by-election aged 21 and 144 days and served in Parliament for 47 continuous years.Last April's report by the Electoral Commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at 21.
