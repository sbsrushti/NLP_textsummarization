Mr Milburn, in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe Labour and Tony Blair are the future while Michael Howard and the Tories would take the country backwards.And, coincidentally, the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called "Fagin" posters which caused Tory protests have not been sacked but, as election supremo Alan Milburn declared, "are doing a very good job".Labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which, for those just returned from the planet Galifray, is "looming".They could, however, picture Michael Howard or, of course, Tony Blair doing it.So it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition's policies and past record.And Tony Blair would be in the very front line of that campaign, he said.It would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between Labour and the Tories."Between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of London than in it but in Britain, not overseas," he promised.
