The law lords' ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary last Thursday following David Blunkett's resignation.House of Lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week.The home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.New Home Secretary Charles Clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to Parliament early in the new year with proposals.Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions "in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons.But the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week.Shadow home secretary David Davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as "competently possible" to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice.The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge.In a statement on the same day, Mr Clarke said: "I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.
