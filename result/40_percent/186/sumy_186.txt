Tony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his "Nazi" comment to a Jewish reporter.Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is "standing by" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a "concentration camp guard".Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use."It's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face," he said.The row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP.At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise.The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London's bid for the 2012 Games.An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England.
