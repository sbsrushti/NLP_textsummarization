Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth.His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region.On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' "lies and spin".Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining "an already crowded field on the right of British politics".Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had "gone AWOL" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.
