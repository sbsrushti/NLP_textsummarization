It's become commonplace to argue that Blair and Brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going.The key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they'd be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.Now this isn't because the participants are stupid - it's actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them.The story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime, and are locked up in separate cells.But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime.Without a confession, the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.Clearly the prisoners' best strategy is to keep their mouths shut, and take the short sentence, but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk.Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up.The prisoners' dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades.What economics tells us is that once you're in a prisoners' dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it's hard to escape the perverse logic of it.In the case of the Labour Party, if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, Solomon's wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem.An example, is the famous rule that "one divides, the other chooses" as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children.In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row.The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in.If the rest of the party can enforce that, they'll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.
