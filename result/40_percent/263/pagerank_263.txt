And if your partner does confess, you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life.The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off.He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime.What economics tells us is that once you're in a prisoners' dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it's hard to escape the perverse logic of it.It's no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms, or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on.In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row.Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on.And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going.And he tells them that if they don't confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they'll get life.Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.Indeed, there's even a piece of economic theory that explains all this.Clearly the prisoners' best strategy is to keep their mouths shut, and take the short sentence, but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk.Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up.Nothing as obscure as "post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory" which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.Now this isn't because the participants are stupid - it's actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them.
