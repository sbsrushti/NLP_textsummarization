Middlesbrough mayor Ray Mallon has been drafted in to boost the Yes campaign as the North East assembly referendum enters its final week.The former police chief, dubbed Robocop for his zero tolerance style, clashed on Thursday with Sunderland No campaigner Neil Herron.Mr Mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime.The pair met on the platform at Sunderland station as Mr Mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly.On Wednesday, Mr Mallon provoked fury by branding the official No Campaign "two-bit Tories" in a confrontation outside its Durham headquarters.Most local observers believe the contest is too close to call, although little recent polling has been carried out.He added: "The government exerts a lot of political power in the North East.He also defended the decision to attack the official No campaign's alleged political allegiances."We felt we had to show what people were behind the No campaign - London Tory spin doctors."And he hit back at Mr Mallon's claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region.
