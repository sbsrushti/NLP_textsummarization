The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.The High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights.The families' solicitor Phil Shiner described it as "a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the UK".The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.Ministry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction.They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK's jurisdiction.After the ruling Carla Ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation Redress, said: "It is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors.Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: "Obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment.I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority.But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : "Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out."The Ministry of Defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war."
