The High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights.The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.Ministry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction.They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK's jurisdiction.And it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred "has been timely, open or effective", the judges said.He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment.But judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern Iraq were ruled out."There must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body.Because we don't want people thinking that British soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it'," he said.Other allegations involving British soldiers included the shooting of an Iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four Iraqi civilians in May 2003.The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.
