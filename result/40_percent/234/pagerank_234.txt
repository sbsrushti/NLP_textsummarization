Mr Blunkett said he wanted "to go back to a time when I was very young, when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work".Police forces were already "buried" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them," said Mr Davis.The plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted.The best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed.Earlier Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.Local people would also be able to "trigger" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done.Mr Blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers.Before delivering a statement to MPs, Mr Blunkett was joined by Tony Blair at Welling School, in south east London, which is at the heart of a community policing initiative.People could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in England and Wales unveiled by David Blunkett.Opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork.
