People could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in England and Wales unveiled by David Blunkett.The plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter.Tory spokesman David Davis said the proposals were "little more than a taxpayer-funded PR exercise" ahead of a general election predicted for next May.Police forces were already "buried" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them," said Mr Davis.Earlier Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police."But these measures will only work if they're matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets."Before delivering a statement to MPs, Mr Blunkett was joined by Tony Blair at Welling School, in south east London, which is at the heart of a community policing initiative.He has also started to recruit 25,000 Community Support Officers (CSOs) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects.A Mori poll this summer suggested policing, unlike health and education, was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it.The plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted.
