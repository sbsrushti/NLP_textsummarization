The powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in England and Wales on Thursday.The Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.CSOs can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive."The powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling," she said.The Home Office has produced its own report on CSOs which it describes as "encouraging".Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as "eyes and ears" for the police.The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging.But Home Office minister Hazel Blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers "just that little bit of edge".Shadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures.
