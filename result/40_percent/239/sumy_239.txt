The Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.The powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in England and Wales on Thursday.The federation said CSOs do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with "potentially confrontational" situations.CSOs can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive.Ms Berry said this "dramatically changes" their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour.Ms Blears said the study shows CSOs are "making a real difference" in the fight against crime.Shadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures."While the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone," he said.BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the research is inconclusive.The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging.
