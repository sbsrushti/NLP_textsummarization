The Conservatives have been "a lot smarter" in the way they have conducted the general election campaign, a Labour backbencher has said. Derek Wyatt said having a five month campaign "turned off voters" and suggested people were already "rather bored of the thing". But Mr Wyatt argued: "By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. "Labour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been "trying very hard" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a "sort of campaign of trust". A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role.
