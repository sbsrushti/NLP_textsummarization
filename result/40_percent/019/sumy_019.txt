The first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk "once in a while" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed.The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said.Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been "obscured" by the remark.The one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk.But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were "a recognition that people will get drunk".Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: "I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister.He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk.Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were "off the mark", they were bound to "come back and bite him".He added: "Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters.The Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his "ill-judged comment" and withdraw it immediately.He told Ms Sturgeon: "It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I 'should encourage young people to get drunk'.Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite."
