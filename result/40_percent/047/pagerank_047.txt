In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by Â£2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed.Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out."We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option."They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated."However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here."A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.Mr Wallace said: "Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain.
