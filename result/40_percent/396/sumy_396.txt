Labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on "cold calling" householders.The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls.Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has written to the watchdog accusing Labour of a "flagrant and systematic breach" of the laws governing the TPS.He says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future.His letter to the commissioner quotes from a Labour Party handbook about "identifying target voters".And it quotes a Stevenage Labour Party members' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions."For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote."Mr Taylor tells the commissioner: "It is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the Labour Party is engaging in a large-scale voter ID project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour.A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be Mr Taylor's.If it fails to do so after two or three warning letters, the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing.Labour says it avoids those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making "voter identification" calls."As the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law.
