Labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on "cold calling" householders.The information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the Lib Dems about how Labour uses its call centres. The party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has written to the watchdog accusing Labour of a "flagrant and systematic breach" of the laws governing the TPS.He says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future.The voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention, ranging from "Labour (firm)" to "target (Conservative)" - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting Tory. "For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote."Mr Taylor tells the commissioner: "It is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the Labour Party is engaging in a large-scale voter ID project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings. A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour. If it fails to do so after two or three warning letters, the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing. If the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules, it could be fined up to Â£5,000. Asked about the commissioner's inquiry, a Labour spokesman told BBC News: "We expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. "As the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law.
