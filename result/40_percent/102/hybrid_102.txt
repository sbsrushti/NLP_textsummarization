Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny. At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.On Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinn's nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average. But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. In his first comments since Sir Alan's announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail." There was "deceit at the heart of government" which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued.He said: "Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. In a statement, the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry's findings. He said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.
