Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny.Sir Alan Budd found a "chain of events" linked Mr Blunkett to Leoncia Casalme's indefinite leave to remain application.But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance.In his first comments since Sir Alan's announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail.Asked if Mr Blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: "I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains.The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a "grubby government".He said Mr Blunkett's integrity remained intact: "He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up.Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was "a strong case for a judge-led judicial review".Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan's findings.
