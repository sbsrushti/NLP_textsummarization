New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions "in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons.The foreign secretary said the right to life was the "most important liberty" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism.He said the Law Lords' ruling was an "embarrassment" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.Law lords were "simply wrong" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily.The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released.He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court.The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism.The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge.
