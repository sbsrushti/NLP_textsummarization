But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury.A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror laws says the current system is giving Britain a bad name.Mr MacDonald said he had "no idea" whether further resignations would follow.Mr MacDonald told BBC News: "The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion.He was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists.The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday.Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful.They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects."When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review," she said.
