Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday.Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week.It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score.He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week.The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to "compromise".But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills.His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a "massive upheaval".The government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week.
