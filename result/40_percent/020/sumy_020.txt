Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay."It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response," said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman."Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity," said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener.But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills."One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system," he said.Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students.A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills.In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in "functional" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs.Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a "massive upheaval".The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.
