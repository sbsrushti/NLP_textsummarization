Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year.The comments come after Tony Blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals, warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting.Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority it would be "unwise" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack.Asked about Sir Ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: "We believe the threat is real."The spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign.Earlier, writing in the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were "difficult issues for any government".But Mr Blair insisted: "There is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack."Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Mr Blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of "using national security for political point scoring".Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy says that the plan is a further example of Labour's "authoritarian" response to crises.The Prevention of Terrorism Bill proposes "control orders", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.They would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against.
