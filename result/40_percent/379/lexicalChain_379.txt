Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year. Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority it would be "unwise" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. "This year we are responsible for the EU presidency, presidency of the G8, a royal wedding and a general election. " Sir Ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers. " The spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. Earlier, writing in the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were "difficult issues for any government". The Commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition, with the government's majority more than halved as 32 Labour rebels joined Tory and Lib Dem opposition. "Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Mr Blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of "using national security for political point scoring". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy says that the plan is a further example of Labour's "authoritarian" response to crises. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill proposes "control orders", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.
