Terrorists might try to target the UK in the run-up to the election, London's most senior police officer has said.Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year. Other potential targets were the royal wedding and the UK's presidency of the European Union and G8, he said. He refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority it would be "unwise" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack."This year we are responsible for the EU presidency, presidency of the G8, a royal wedding and a general election." Sir Ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers. Asked about Sir Ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: "We believe the threat is real." The spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. Earlier, writing in the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were "difficult issues for any government". But critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders.
