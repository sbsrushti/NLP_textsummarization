Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Mr Blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of "using national security for political point scoring".Sir Ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers.Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority it would be "unwise" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack.No 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year.He refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack.Earlier, writing in the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were "difficult issues for any government".Other potential targets were the royal wedding and the UK's presidency of the European Union and G8, he said.Terrorists might try to target the UK in the run-up to the election, London's most senior police officer has said.Home Secretary Charles Clarke has also warned that a Madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the UK too.
