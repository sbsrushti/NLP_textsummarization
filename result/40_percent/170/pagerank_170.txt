The contract with the Powys health board was worth Â£7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients."We appeal to Powys Local Health Board to allow Powys people to choose Hereford for their treatment.""But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate," said the assembly government.But after talks with Powys Health Board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in January.Andy Williams, chief executive of Powys Local Health Board, had said it was "a totally unacceptable way to behave".But after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, Mr Williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure Welsh patients continued to be treated there.Mr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh-English issue, but said Hereford hospital was "struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys".Hereford County Hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations.Shocked health officials in Powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals.
