An English hospital has suspended plans to stop treating Welsh patients who have waited more than three months.Shocked health officials in Powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals.Andy Williams, chief executive of Powys Local Health Board, had said it was "a totally unacceptable way to behave".Mr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh-English issue, but said Hereford hospital was "struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys".But after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, Mr Williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure Welsh patients continued to be treated there.He said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between England and Wales.The contract with the Powys health board was worth Â£7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients."But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate," said the assembly government.Earlier, David Rose, Chief Executive of Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, had said: "It is with real regret that we have taken this step."In 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want Powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital.
