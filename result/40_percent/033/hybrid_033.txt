Campaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.BAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the Â£2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.The campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London." The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.The airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.
