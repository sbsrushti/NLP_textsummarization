The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes "a pile of pants".The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4.They are in it to fill their boots," Mr Pound told the Today programme.The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to "protect children and the vulnerable" in a swiftly changing sector.Ms Jowell insisted: "We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing."Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday.In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.
