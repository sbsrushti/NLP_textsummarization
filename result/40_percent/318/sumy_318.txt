Labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the UK's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists, says a race group.Local councillor Lyn Brown was selected for West Ham, east London, in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women.An Operation Black Vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet Labour party chairman Ian McCartney for discussions.Last month the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances.A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament."We will be raising it with each of the party leaders on a formal basis and helping them find the most appropriate way forward," the spokesman said.
