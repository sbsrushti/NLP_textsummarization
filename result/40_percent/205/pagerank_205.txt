Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at Guantanamo Bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the UK.Twelve foreign nationals are being held indefinitely without trial in the UK under anti-terror laws.The South African archbishop said detentions without trial were "unacceptable" and "distressing".Foreign nationals detained in the UK are being held at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons.Referring to the detentions in Cuba, Archbishop Tutu told BBC News: "It is utterly unacceptable."We in South Africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable.Archbishop Tutu criticised the measures, saying: "I am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening, even in Britain."The Britons were detained as part of the US-led "war on terror".Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, has called on the government to "practise what it preaches" and either free or charge the detained men.
