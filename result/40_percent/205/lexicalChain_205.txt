Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at Guantanamo Bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the UK. His comments follow news that all four Britons held by the US in the Cuban camp will be freed within weeks. Referring to the detentions in Cuba, Archbishop Tutu told BBC News: "It is utterly unacceptable. "The rule of law is in order to ensure that those who have power don't use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty. "Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US at Guantanamo Bay for almost three years. On Tuesday Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons that the US had agreed to release the four after "intensive and complex discussions" over security. "We in South Africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable. " Following Mr Straw's announcement, lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. In December the House of Lords, the UK's highest court, ruled that the anti-terror measures broke human rights laws. Archbishop Tutu criticised the measures, saying: "I am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening, even in Britain.
