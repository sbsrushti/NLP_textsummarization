A national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up, a committee of MPs has said.The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council.In its report on the council's work the committee said: "We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences."It is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of Economic and Social Research Council's limited resources.A national "strategic capabilities fund" to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response, the committee added.
