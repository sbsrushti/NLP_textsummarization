There was an "absolute crisis" in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts, the Commons science and technology committee added. "Major problems" are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age, it said.The council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. In its report on the council's work the committee said: "We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences." A national "strategic capabilities fund" to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response, the committee added.
