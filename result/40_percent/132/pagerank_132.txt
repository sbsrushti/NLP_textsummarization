Mr Johnson told Age Concern's Age Agenda in London the government was "seriously considering" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions.This was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, Alan Johnson said.Speaking at the London conference he said: "Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination"."And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded".The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were "increasingly consigned to the past".The "myth that ageing is a barrier" to contributing to society needs to be "exploded", the work and pensions minister has said.
