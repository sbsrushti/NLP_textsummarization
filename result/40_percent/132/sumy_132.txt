The "myth that ageing is a barrier" to contributing to society needs to be "exploded", the work and pensions minister has said.All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.Mr Johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system.Speaking at the London conference he said: "Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination".The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were "increasingly consigned to the past"."We're sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we're giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously.Mr Johnson said his department had a long-term aspiration of moving towards an 80% employment rate.This would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force, he said.
