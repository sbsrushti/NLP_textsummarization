In cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were "determined" they would be dealt with "as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible", it said.The Tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use "grossly disproportionate" force.And the law protects those who use "something to hand" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).The government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary.But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of "excessive and gratuitous" force.That's exactly what should be the case and I believe the current law provides that."The guidance published on Tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury.The law also protects those who use "something to hand" as a weapon.The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use "reasonable force".
