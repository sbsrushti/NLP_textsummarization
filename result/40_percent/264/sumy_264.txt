Tony Blair's big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.The prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto.There was a detailed account of the government's past record, with a major emphasis on the economy and public services.There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown.His was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what New Labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach.To that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it, possibly through some gritted teeth, in 2001, and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters.In a key section, he declared: "In our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity.Under what is to be the general election slogan "Britain is working", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour.Probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men, in so far as there is one, is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services.An unremittingly "New" Labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them.With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word.
