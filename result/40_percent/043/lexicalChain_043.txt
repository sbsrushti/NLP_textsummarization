Political parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern. Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a "decisive blow" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. "Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote. Age Concern says the over-55s are "united around" key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.
