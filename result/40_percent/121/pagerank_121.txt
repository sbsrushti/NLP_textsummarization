"But let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in Wales that are waiting far too long."Meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in Wales has fallen by 9.8%."However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England," he said.Welsh Health Minister Jane Hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by March 2006, against a current target of 18 months."It leaves patients in Wales still waiting two years before they're treated."Hospital waiting times for patients in Wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in England.On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced Â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.Conservative health spokesman Jonathan Morgan said: "We're spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof.Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), welcomed the new targets "to make further and faster progress on waiting lists".The announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop.This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.But she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for March 2006.
