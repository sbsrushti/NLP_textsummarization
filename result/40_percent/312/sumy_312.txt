Talks aimed at averting national strikes over pension reforms have ended without agreement after 90 minutes.Five public sector unions met Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the Labour spring conference in Gateshead.They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65.A spokesman for Unison, Britain's biggest union, said after Saturday's meeting: "At least we are still talking."All sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape.In four days, Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes.The five unions which met Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations.But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April.PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week.
