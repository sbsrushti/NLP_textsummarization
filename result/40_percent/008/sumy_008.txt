Women MPs endure "shocking" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered "melons" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told.Labour's Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary.Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study "Whose Secretary are You, minister".The research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster.And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women "Betty".Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: "Well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman."Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: "Lots of people say it's like an old boys club.Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings.This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to "put up with" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said.
