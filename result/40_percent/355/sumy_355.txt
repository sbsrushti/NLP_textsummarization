Public trust in the handling of the economy can only be restored if Gordon Brown opens up his books for unbiased inspection, say the Lib Dems.City experts say there is a £10bn "black hole" in the public finances, a claim denied by the chancellor.Lib Dem spokesman Vince Cable said the public did not know who to believe and the National Audit Office should judge.In his report, Mr Brown insisted he was on course to meet his "golden rule" of borrowing only to invest, rather than for day-to-day spending, over the course of the economic cycle.He argued: "There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt.Mr Cable compared that new cost with the £500m needed for Britain's role in the entire first Gulf War - when 80% of the bill had been met through help from European and Arab nations.He suggested keeping British troops in Iraq could cost another £1bn with the government also planning to spend at least £3bn for identity cards.The current economic climate meant Britain could not afford the "reckless, George Bush-style tax cutting spree" planned by the Tories, he said.Instead, what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the "complete mess" produced by Mr Brown's endless tinkering.With that record, he asked why ministers attacked Lib Dem plans for a new 50% tax rate for the "very rich" - those earning more than £100,000 a year.But the Lib Dem spokesman questioned whether that money was being found from cuts to education and health.It was because he had rejected previous Lib Dem proposals, such as scrapping the New Deal, that Britain's economy was successful, claimed Mr Brown.
