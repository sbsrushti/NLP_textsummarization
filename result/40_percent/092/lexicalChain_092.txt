Ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday's figures offer a progress check. Police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. Prime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance. Ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that "about a third" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.
