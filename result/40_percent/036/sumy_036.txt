In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and "populist scares".On the Asian tsunami he said it had been "very heartening" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons.Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period.At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.The general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party "fades away" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said."Labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity.It was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison, ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said.He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and ID card plans.His party "instinctively" understood the "new liberal Britain" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said.
