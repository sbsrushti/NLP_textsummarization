The 51-year-old premier has marked his 2,838th day in the post, overtaking the combined length of Harold Wilson's two terms during the 1960s and 1970s.If Mr Blair wins the next election and fulfils his promise to serve a full third term, he will surpass Margaret Thatcher's 11 years by the end of 2008.The last prime minister to be installed at a younger age was Lord Liverpool, who was a year his junior in 1812.Labour won a huge majority of 167 over the Conservatives in 2001, but Mr Blair has since been criticised by many in his own party.The war in Iraq and reforms of the health service and education system have provoked dissent from backbenchers.When asked about the future leadership of the party, he told ITV Wales' Waterfront programme: "That contest is a long way away and it will occur only when the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, decides he's subscribed all he can and then wants to go."I think that the main contender will be Gordon Brown, who is a man of virtually unmatched capability and now great experience."
