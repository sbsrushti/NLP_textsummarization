Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees.Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's "chaotic" asylum system under Tony Blair.Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity."On Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.""We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.""When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers.If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.But he said it was "absolutely disgusting" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997.
