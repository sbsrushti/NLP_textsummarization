Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's "chaotic" asylum system under Tony Blair.The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997.Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused.Other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked Tory plans for annual limits on numbers."The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution," he was due to say.Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees.If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.That prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled."If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven," said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council."By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse," said Mr Blair.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.
