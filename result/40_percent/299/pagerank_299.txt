Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary.Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: "This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards.The party has been "agnostic" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said.The decision follows a "tough meeting" where some senior Tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the BBC.Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected."It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect," a spokesman said.
