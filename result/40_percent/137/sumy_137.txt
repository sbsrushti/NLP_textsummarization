The Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law.Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal.The man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford.The group, from South Wales and Ireland, have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.They were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters.Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules.Before riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: "We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned."Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers.The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was "impossibly difficult to determine" and open to different interpretations.The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law.
