Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs.Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts.And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was "impossibly difficult to determine" and open to different interpretations.The Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law.It is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday, just one day after the ban came in.Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed.Before riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: "We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned."He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police "in the near future" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.
