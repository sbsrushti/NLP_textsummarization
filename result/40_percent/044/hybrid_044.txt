Senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the Queen and Prince of Wales are to be questioned by MPs.Aides from the Duchy of Lancaster and Duchy of Cornwall will appear before the Commons Public Accounts Committee. The Duchy of Lancaster provides the Queen's private income, while the Duchy of Cornwall provides Prince Charles' annual income. It was set up in 1337 by King Edward III to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. It covers the cost of the prince's public and private life - neither Charles, nor William and Harry, receive taxpayers' money from the Civil List. The prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993.
