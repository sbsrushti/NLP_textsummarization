Mr Bannatyne has previously given Labour Â£50,000.But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not "perceived as a problem by the voters," adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence.Mr Bannatyne said: "Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country.Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was "not an alternative source of opposition to the government".He warned the "Abstentions Party" was the real challenge to Labour - and they would not be motivated by Mr Blair's promise to produce an "unremittingly New Labour" election manifesto.The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt.His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point.
