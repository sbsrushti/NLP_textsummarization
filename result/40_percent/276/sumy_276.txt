The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.Duncan Bannatyne also attacked the government over Iraq and its "poor" response to the Asian tsunami crisis.His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point.His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.Robert Peston's new book has prompted more speculation about the Blair-Brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down."Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition."The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq.British Navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid.Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was "not an alternative source of opposition to the government".His comments come after Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain's biggest union Unison, told the Daily Record newspaper he wants a date to be set for Mr Blair to be replaced as Labour leader.
