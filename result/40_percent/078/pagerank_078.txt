The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania."The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.""We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities."The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims."In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure."We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused," said the spokesman."We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children "and leave them to rot".'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision."These children automatically become the responsibility of social services."We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania].Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18.
