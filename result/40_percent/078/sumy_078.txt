The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.Children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected.The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18.At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers.Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing "the difficult issue" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children.A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children "and leave them to rot"."We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused," said the spokesman."We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies."From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account," said Mr Hogg.
