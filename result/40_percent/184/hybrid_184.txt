Tony Blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the Iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.The prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the Attorney General. He refused to answer further questions on the issue, saying it had been dealt with "literally scores of times and the position has not changed".The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. Mr Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence, told the BBC on Friday: "That, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule.Mr Mates added: "We discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers' advice to the government has been published. when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. She told the BBC the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code."My view is we need the House of Lords to set up a special committee, summon the attorney, get all the papers out, look at exactly what happened," she said. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.
