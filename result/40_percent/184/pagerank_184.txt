Mr Blair said the statement was a "fair summary" of Lord Goldsmith's opinion.But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action.Mr Mates added: "We discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers' advice to the government has been published.Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: "Firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it."Tony Blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the Iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.Earlier, Conservative MP Michael Mates joined calls for a probe into claims Lord Goldsmith's statement to Parliament was drawn up at Number 10.Mr Sands' book suggests it was actually written by Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan.He has dealt with this time and time and time again," Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street.The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.
