Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.- Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for "national security" - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps.Mr Howard called that suggestion "disgraceful".Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough.In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case.The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.He did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race.Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin."We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum," Mr Howard said.
