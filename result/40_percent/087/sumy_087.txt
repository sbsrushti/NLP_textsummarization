Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.Some charities say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled."By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse," said Mr Blair.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."- Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for "national security" - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps.Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough."We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum," Mr Howard said."By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling."Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans "dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible".Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.
