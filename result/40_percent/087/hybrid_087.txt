Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. Some charities say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. "By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse," said Mr Blair. - Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers  - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents  - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for "national security"  - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps.Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. "By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling."But the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture.
