Immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time.Labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the Tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.The challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.Former union leader Sir Bill Morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a "bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers".That has been attacked by the Tories as too little, too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the UK.But, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before."My concern is that, whilst the Labour Party and the Conservative Party will take a constructive approach to the debate, right-wing political parties, picking up on statements like `burden to Britain' will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty".
