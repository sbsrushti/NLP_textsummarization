They have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues, with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes.But it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or, alternatively, running scared of addressing the problem.The Tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration, with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the UK.Labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the Tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.Now Home Secretary Charles Clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry, and to kick out more failed asylum seekers.But, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before.Former union leader Sir Bill Morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a "bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers".The challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.
