 They have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues, with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes. But this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies. Labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the Tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue. That has been attacked by the Tories as too little, too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the UK.But, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before."My concern is that, whilst the Labour Party and the Conservative Party will take a constructive approach to the debate, right-wing political parties, picking up on statements like `burden to Britain' will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty". It is precisely that concern - and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right's racist agenda - that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue. The challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.
