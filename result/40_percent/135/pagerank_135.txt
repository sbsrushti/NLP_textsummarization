Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give "hundreds of millions" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.The British public has now pledged £76m in aid with emergency supplies from the British government starting to arrive in the region on three RAF flights in a joint operation with Scandinavian countries.Mr Brown, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, says he has been in "intensive talks" with other G8 finance ministers.Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery.The prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in Egypt.Germany proposed a freeze last week and Canada has begun its own moratorium.Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is to visit Thailand and Indonesia this week.Chancellor Gordon Brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.During his trip, Mr Straw will represent the G8 at the international conference called in Jakarta, Indonesia on Thursday.The prime minister took personal charge of the UK's response on Tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since Boxing Day.The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the £50m given by the government so far only "six or seven million" had been spent.
