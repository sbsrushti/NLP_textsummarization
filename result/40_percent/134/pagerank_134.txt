We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again," hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said."The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements.He said police had "acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences".Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.As well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to "flush out" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them.The Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend.He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police "in the near future" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions.But Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations.
