Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.The law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force.Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them."The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements."You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one," he said.The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law.He has rejected a "blanket policy" of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality.John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices.But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that "people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about".
