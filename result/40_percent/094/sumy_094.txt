Scotland's first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk "once in a while".But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were "a recognition that people will get drunk".He said: "I hope I'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them.""Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly."We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening."He added: "By all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly."SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: "This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell."We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk.But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind.
