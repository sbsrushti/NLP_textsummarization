The four Britons freed from US custody in Guantanamo Bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative.Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi and Richard Belmar were held for three years, accused of al-Qaeda links.The men are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers.Before being driven by police from Birmingham to London, Azmat Begg said he was concerned for his son Moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug.As Azmat Begg arrived at the London police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements.But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was "absolutely" inadmissible in UK courts.Louise Christian said that after being "tortured and abused" at Guantanamo Bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate.Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them.The Pentagon says they were freed after the UK government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies.The detainees were immediately arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 when they landed at RAF Northolt, west London, on Tuesday."We want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family," said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the council.
