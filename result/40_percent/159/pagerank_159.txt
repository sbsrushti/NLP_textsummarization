Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto.Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain.The Conservatives would stand up for the "forgotten majority", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.Mr Howard told BBC News: "I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep."The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said.The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values.Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans.Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue "down the path of ever rising taxes".Labour's election slogan will be: "Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again".Labour says the document offers only a return to a "failed Tory past"."The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust," he said.
