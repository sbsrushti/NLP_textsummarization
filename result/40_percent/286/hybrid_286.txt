Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be "made available to law-abiding members of the community" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. "The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate." Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: "I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway. "He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken. He added: "I can't comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven't seen the papers yet.
