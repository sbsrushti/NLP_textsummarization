The lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups, Amnesty International's chief has said.In a lecture at the London School of Economics, Irene Khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 September, 2001.She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message.Ms Khan highlighted detentions without trial, including those at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems.The Amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism."Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups," she said.Ms Khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system.There needed to be a drive to use simpler language, talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes.Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.Despite her concerns, Ms Khan dubbed herself a "hope-monger", saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.
