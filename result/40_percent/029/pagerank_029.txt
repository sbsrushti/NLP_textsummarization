Nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has announced.In a written statement, Mr Straw said: "The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change.The Foreign Office currently has about 6,100 UK-based staff.Since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding Wednesday's cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened.Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions."Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts.Other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff.The chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings.
