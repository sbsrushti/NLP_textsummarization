Mr Kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned Labour voters.He also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to Old Labour.Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the Tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims."This is really going to be the first modern three party UK election that we have all experienced"."The problem is that, geographically, the Conservative party has melted away in about a third of Britain.Charles Kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament "on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us"."I think the tax argument has moved on a lot in British politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election," he said."We are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies".But even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months' time.But doesn't that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second?
