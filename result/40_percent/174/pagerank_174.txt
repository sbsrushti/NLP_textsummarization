She said: "The Scottish Executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of Mr Ferguson was a matter for Carstairs.The Scottish Executive said ministers would be notified but it would "not be common practice" to sign approval."But at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised."Ms Brankin said: "The first minister has called for a review of what has happened, we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this."He said: "We understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for Michael Ferguson to be released unescorted from Carstairs."The executive concedes that it is up to Scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it.First Minister Jack McConnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded.Scottish Conservative leader, David McLetchie, said earlier it was "almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen"."However, my understanding is that, under the mental health legislation, the decision to grant this patient - and any restricted patient - leave of absence, would have required direct and specific authorisation by Scottish ministers.""They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision."I have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on.Ms Sturgeon has written to Mr McConnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out.
