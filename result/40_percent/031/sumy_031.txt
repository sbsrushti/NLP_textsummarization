David Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced "prematurely" via press release a review of murder laws.On Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales.News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday.Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday.In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder.The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases.Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was "indefensible and should cease".The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence.But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence.The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.
