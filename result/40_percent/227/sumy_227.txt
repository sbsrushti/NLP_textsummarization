Charles Clarke faces his first real test as home secretary on Monday with a possible backbench rebellion over the controversial ID cards bill.Mr Clarke, who took on the post on Thursday after David Blunkett quit, has rejected calls to "pause" on the bill.Tory leader Michael Howard also faces a possible rebellion after deciding to back identity cards.Mr Clarke, writing in The Times, accused some critics of "liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears" by claiming ID cards would erode civil liberties.Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail.Mr Howard last week said his front bench team had reached a "collective view" to back ID cards after holding a "good discussion", but admitted it was "not an easy issue".He told BBC Radio 4's Today the government was "intensely authoritarian" and was creating "increasingly a Big Brother society".On Sunday, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy repeated his call for a "pause" in considering the legislation."If you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the Identity Cards Bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the New Year?
