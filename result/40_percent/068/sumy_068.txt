MPs are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia "by the back door".The bill would give legal force to "living wills", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated.The Mental Capacity Bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment.Ministers insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.It would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors.An amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith.Peter Saunders of the CMF said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory, not legally binding.Ex-Labour minister Frank Field told BBC Two's Newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to "do away" with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets.Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy said laws affecting 750,000 people with dementia needed updating.Mr Lammy told BBC News Labour MPs would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened, not changed."We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law," he said.Debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the UK because of cases like that of motor neurone patient Diane Pretty.
