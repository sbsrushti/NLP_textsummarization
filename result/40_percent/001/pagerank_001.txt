She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400."The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as "desperate", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children.She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid.Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt."We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament."Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: "While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected."
