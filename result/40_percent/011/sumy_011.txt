Michael Howard's ex-model wife, Sandra, is to play a leading role in the Conservative election campaign.Mrs Howard will make solo visits to target seats as well as accompanying her husband on his helicopter campaign trail criss-crossing the country.Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party's London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said.But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference.Mr Fox responded by accusing the prime minister of "hiding away from the scrutiny of London's media".The Liberal Democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with Charles Kennedy.Mrs Howard made her debut speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth last October.
