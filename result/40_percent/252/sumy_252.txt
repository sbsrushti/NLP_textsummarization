Tony Blair promised Gordon Brown he would stand down before the next election, a new book about the chancellor claims.The book by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston said the pair had "mutual animosity and contempt" for each other.The book, Brown's Britain, said Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust.The book, serialised in the Sunday Telegraph, alleges that Mr Blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy PM John Prescott in November 2003 of his intention to stand down.But he changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, the book claims."I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."Rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold Mr Blair's monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new "Marshall Plan" for Africa.Former welfare minister Frank Field MP criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on GMTV's Sunday Programme.Carol Walker, BBC News 24 political correspondent, added: "There is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign."And clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster."
