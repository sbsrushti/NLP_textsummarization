Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers.Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said the government had failed to remove 250,000 failed asylum seekers from the UK and limits on economic migrants had been a "shambles".But he said it was yet to be seen if Mr Clarke could deliver "a fair and efficient asylum system".The government's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May.Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: "We should cut the number or increase it depending on the country's needs... "The public are worried about this, they are worried rightly, because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system."New controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on Monday.Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair.Instead, they say the plans are part of an "evolving" process aimed at winning public confidence.
