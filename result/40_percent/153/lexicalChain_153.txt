New controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on Monday. Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system. The government's new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May. The prime minister on Sunday said immigration would be "toughened up" to ensure only those immigrants with skills the UK really needs will be granted work permits. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: "We should cut the number or increase it depending on the country's needs. Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair. pretending there is some simple easy way of processing Britain's asylum seekers in some other country, because no such other country exists.
