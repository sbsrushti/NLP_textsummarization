Prime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.Mr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March.Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so.He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.The BBC's Paul Reynolds says the London conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is expected to win the Palestinian presidential election on 9 January.In an interview with the BBC's political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be "tough, but at least we have got the first step".He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence.
