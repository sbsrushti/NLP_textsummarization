Executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should "be beyond reasonable doubt".The Scottish Executive has lost an appeal against an inmate's compensation for being forced to slop out in prison.An executive spokesman said: "We will study this judgement in detail.On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.The executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates.Much has changed to address the issues raised in the Napier case, for example, slopping out has ended at Barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated.Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought Â£5,000.More than 310 actions have already been raised in the Court of Session and sheriff courts in Scotland."A short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost."
