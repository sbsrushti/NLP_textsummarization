Hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of Islam, President Musharraf of Pakistan has said during a visit to Britain.He was speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the Pakistani community in Manchester.Dr Maleeha Lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.Gen Musharraf told the BBC: "Some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong."The Pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe.On Monday the Pakistani president met Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street, on his first official visit to London.The Mirror newspaper said on Tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of Gen Musharraf's visit to Britain.It said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels, call signs and codes.Speaking in London on Monday, Gen Musharraf said al-Qaeda was "on the run" in Pakistan.Mr Blair said the two leaders had talked about Afghanistan, the wider war on terror, the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir.
