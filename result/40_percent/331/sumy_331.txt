Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: "I can spend the same money twice."The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5".The hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver!"Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice," he told BBC Radio 4's World At One."Whatever the idea is, I think it's a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning."Mr Temko said he blamed "cock-up not conspiracy", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election.Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies."Concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but I would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme... is that the Tories are trying to con you."A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row.
