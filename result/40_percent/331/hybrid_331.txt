The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: "I can spend the same money twice." The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory. The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5".The hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver. Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday."Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image.The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. "Concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but I would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme." A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row. "This has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss," he said. But a Conservative spokeswoman said: "This poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by Labour's campaign team.
