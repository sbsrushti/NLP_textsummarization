Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday.There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members.The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued.It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: "It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches."The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: "I can spend the same money twice."The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5".Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood.The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory.
