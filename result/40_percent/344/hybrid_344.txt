Should he win the next general election, he has earmarked Â£4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.All the money would come from its Â£35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy, waste and the civil service. Of that, Â£23 billion would go on spending plans, with Â£8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by Gordon Brown, and the rest going in tax cuts. As the Tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between Labour and the Tories.It is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts.The extension of that, however, was that Labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the Tories were the cutters.One of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. And, while other issues like the Iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.
