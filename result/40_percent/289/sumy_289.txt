Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has officially been made a life peer during a ceremony in the House of Lords."I accepted the kind invitation to enter the House of Lords as a working peer for practical political reasons," he said when his peerage was first announced."It is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education, sustainable transport, industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns, particularly poverty and oppression."It has been a long journey for the new Lord Kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south Wales valleys.Born in 1942 in Tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother, he attended Lewis Boys' School in nearby Pengam, known then as the "Eton of the valleys".He gained a reputation as a left-wing firebrand, voting against his own Labour government's spending cuts proposals in 1975, and later rejecting a junior post in James Callaghan's administration.He was not expected to win the 1987 election, when Margaret Thatcher was still riding high, but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in 1992 to John Major, and stepped down.As he assumes the title of Lord Kinnock, he has also become chairman of the British Council, which promotes the UK's reputation for arts, science and education.
