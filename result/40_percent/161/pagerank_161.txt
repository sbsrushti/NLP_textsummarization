A deal bringing Turkey a step closer to EU membership is of "fundamental importance" to the peace and security of the world, Tony Blair has said.The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus.Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was "anti-Islamic".Turkey's involvement with the EU would provide an "invaluable bridge" between Europe and the rest of the world, Mr Howard added.It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership.But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey.
