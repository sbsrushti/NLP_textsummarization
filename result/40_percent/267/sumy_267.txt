By any measure, New Yorker Dick Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else - a winner.This is the man who, some pundits believe, was almost single-handedly responsible for Bill Clinton's sensational 1992 comeback victory.He has worked as election strategist for any number of Republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from Mexico to Uruguay.Now he is back in London as the UK Independence Party's not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the Ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko.If there is one regular criticism levelled at Morris, it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances."I was on a cruise in the Mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was UKIP leader Roger Knapman.A great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a New Yorker post 11 September.So he is out to help UKIP take Britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic.But until somebody says they are willing to leave the EU they can't possibly re-negotiate anything (as Michael Howard is pledged to do)."It's like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: 'before I can proceed with the robbery I want to make clear I am not going to shoot anybody'".So is UKIP's job to destroy the Tories, as former member Robert Kilroy-Silk once notoriously declared?"Robert Kilroy Silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one".As with the 2004 US presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in Britain.So, with limited resources, the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the Commons."The internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries)."Labour and the Tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice".That might, he suggests, lead to a hung parliament with UKIP and others holding the balance of power.But there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is Labour's for the taking.UKIP's performance in last year's European elections was just such a shocker and showed that Mr Morris may have a point about the new consensus.
