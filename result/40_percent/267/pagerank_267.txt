So why Britain and why UKIP which, despite its recent EU election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election.UKIP's performance in last year's European elections was just such a shocker and showed that Mr Morris may have a point about the new consensus.The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move."I was on a cruise in the Mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was UKIP leader Roger Knapman.So he is out to help UKIP take Britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic.But what is it about UKIP that particularly attracts him?I think UKIP had a huge amount to do with Tony Blair's decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and I think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro".Neither does UKIP have to fight every seat.So what is the big plan for the general election."The internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries).On this subject, Morris appears almost evangelical.But Morris is no ideologue.And, while we are on the subject of Mr Kilroy-Silk, Mr Morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites."The basic point is that the EU seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from Britain - and we oppose that and the Tories cannot be trusted to oppose it".He has worked as election strategist for any number of Republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from Mexico to Uruguay.But there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is Labour's for the taking."Anything can happen in the next general election.And he is scathing of the Tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.By any measure, New Yorker Dick Morris is that thing Americans love over everything else - a winner.That he enjoys the game more than the politics.
