The Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.Teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.Higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education.Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said.The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994.The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: "It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education.The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: "We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas."Increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.Sir Howard said the report highlighted the "entrenched divisions" between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem.
