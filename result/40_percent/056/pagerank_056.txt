Britain's young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups.The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work.Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said."It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged."The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents.He added: "But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing.Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their "other cultural identities" alongside being British.The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings."This strategy sets out the government's commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society."
