The EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained.German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted."I have long understood China's argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don't think it is," he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls.Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of "the motives of some other countries within the EU" in wanting the ban lifted.But he said many of Washington's objections were based on a "lack of information and understanding" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries.Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan.US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.
