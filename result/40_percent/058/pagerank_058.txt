The EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.Mr Straw said the US government was suspicious of "the motives of some other countries within the EU" in wanting the ban lifted.In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet.He said "it is more likely than not" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July.But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country.US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses.Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained.
