Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said.They called for a "cast-iron guarantee" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing.The environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals.One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail.MPs urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences.Committee chairman Michael Jack said: "Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest.But Mr Jack said the bill "very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that "an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms."The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament," he added.
