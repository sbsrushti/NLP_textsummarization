Gordon Brown has failed to tackle the "fundamental unfairness" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy has said.How was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%, the Lib Dem leader asked.But he criticised both the chancellor and the Tories for failing to address the "ticking bomb" of council tax revaluation.He said the recent experience of Wales indicated seven million households in England would pay significantly more after revaluation.The chancellor's announcement that he was to offer a Â£200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a "sticking plaster" to a much bigger problem.On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a "scandal" that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children.He contrasted his approach with Mr Brown's pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax.
