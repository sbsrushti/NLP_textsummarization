Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. Mr Fox's comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. After the meeting, Mr Fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact.30 on a Saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there's not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn't open on Sunday anyway." Under Acpo's proposal, the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. "It's making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse, and the strategic planning process has been less than useless," he said. "Staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there, if the premises are properly managed and people aren't being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street," he said. Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. It was the status quo, not the new laws, which were causing current binge drinking problems, she told BBC Two's Newsnight. The police's job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added.
