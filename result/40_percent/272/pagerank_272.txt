On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives.He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to "prop up" either of the other big parties after the election.They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power.There was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion.Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.He will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold.And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things.The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.
