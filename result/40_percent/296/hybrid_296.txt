 Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.A jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987. "I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell. "After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world," he added." Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.
