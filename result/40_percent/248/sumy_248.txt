David Blunkett - who has resigned as home secretary - built his reputation as a plain-speaking Yorkshire man.I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story."Trust, plain-speaking and straight talking is something which matters so much to me as a politician and as a man that I have decided, of my own volition, to request an independent review of the allegations that I misused my position.""Our work with the French government...has been hugely successful," said Mr Blunkett."The number of illegal immigrants detected in Dover has dropped dramatically.""Strengthening our identity is one way or reinforcing people's confidence and sense of citizenship and well-being.""I foolishly thought as this was a celebrity edition it would be more relaxed than normal."
