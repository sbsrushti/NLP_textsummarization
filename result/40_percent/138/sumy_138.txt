It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts.The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud."As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources."Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency."Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that they're doing everything possible to weed out improper spending."The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management."A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting.He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a "good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud".
