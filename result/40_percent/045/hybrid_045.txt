The Edinburgh MSP earns up to Â£30,000 a year from the law firm Tods Murray, where he is a partner. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. Glenn said MSPs are advised to guard against a conflict of interests and a perception of a conflict.Mr McLetchie said: "I'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case, that the judgement I took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded." He said nothing had changed in respect of his work with the law firm and it was a matter he would have to discuss with the other partners at Tods Murray. "The firm and I have a very good working relationship and we have done for the last six years," said Mr McLetchie.
