Eight protesters who stormed the House of Commons chamber during a debate on the Hunting Bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted.Five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them."If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can't do so retrospectively.Otis Ferry, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: "I have no regrets.One of the men, David Redvers, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.The other protesters are John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, Robert Thame, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles in Team Highgrove, auctioneer Andrew Elliot, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury, point-to-point jockey Richard Wakeham, 34, from York, and former royal chef Nick Wood, 41.Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder.In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales.However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt.The alliance said the 19 February meets would show the new law was "impossibly difficult to determine" and open to different interpretations.
