The Tories failed to hold onto power in 1974 after Liberals demanded Sir Edward Heath quit in return for co-operation.Documents released after 30 years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic February general election.But it partly collapsed over the Conservative leader's own role, prompting the Queen to ask Harold Wilson to form a Labour government.The February 1974 general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control.Sir Edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis, a miners' strike and the subsequent three-day week.Labour emerged with the most seats - but its 301 MPs were 17 short of the number Mr Wilson needed to form a majority.According to the documents released at the National Archives, the "friendly and easy" first meeting indicated that both Sir Edward and Mr Thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal.Hours later Sir Edward's hopes of a deal unravelled as Mr Thorpe's colleagues refused to support him."Jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally," reads a telephone memo for Mr Heath."Asked if this was his own view he said - no it was not, I am very close to Ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve - it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult."The following day, the stickling points had clearly become two-fold: Mr Thorpe's colleagues wanted electoral reform and Sir Edward's resignation.Four hours later, Sir Edward called the Liberal leader back to Downing Street in a last attempt at a deal.
