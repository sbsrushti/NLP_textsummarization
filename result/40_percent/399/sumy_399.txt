Sacked MP Howard Flight's local Conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election.Russell Tanguay, agent for Arundel and South Downs Tories, said Mr Flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute.Mr Tanguay backed that view on Tuesday, saying: "Howard Flight is ineligible to stand as a Conservative Party candidate.Mr Flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM).Labour election campaign coordinator Alan Milburn said the Tories were in "turmoil" because Mr Flight had exposed their hidden plans.The comments were not a "one-off", he said, claiming Mr Howard and other senior Tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said: "Whilst I disagree with Howard Flight's views, it seems extraordinary to sack somebody for telling the truth."It has also emerged Mr Howard has suspended Slough's constituency Conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate.Adrian Hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, under John Major's government, was an act of treason.The Catholic Herald also highlighted articles he wrote about the role of Catholicism in the European Union.Mr Hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate, Robert Oulds, was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife.He said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the BBC News website on Monday evening.
