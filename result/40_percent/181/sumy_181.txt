The prime minister launched a Â£500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010.But the Conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours' PE within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.The latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and Tai Chi being options.Launching the initiative, Mr Blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London.Earlier, Education Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC News there were at least three areas which needed "a coherent framework" and "dedicated funding".These were training for PE teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions.But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee.Martin Ward, of the Secondary Heads Association, said members did not like "ring-fenced funds" and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.
