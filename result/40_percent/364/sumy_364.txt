Tory leader Michael Howard has dismissed Gordon Brown's Budget as "vote now, pay later" spending plans.The simple fact was that under a new Labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, Mr Howard said.Labour's "faltering election campaign" would not be helped by the package of measures, Mr Howard added.Mr Brown's Budget was not about what was good for the country, but "all about the interests of the Labour party," the Tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign.He urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging "millions of people in to the net" to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax."We can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if Labour wins."Mr Brown liked to rattle off "magical balances conjured out of thin air" in a bid to convince people there was no "black hole" in the nation's finances, the Tory leader said.There was nothing in the Budget that would put more police on the streets, make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools.
