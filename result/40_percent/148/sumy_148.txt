Three Labour councillors in Birmingham were caught operating a "vote-rigging factory", an Election Court has heard.Police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in June 2004, the hearing was told.Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election.The special Election Court, the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging, opened in Birmingham last month.They claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 June election.Ravi Sukul, counsel for the petitioners, accused the three men of being "deeply involved" in illegal practices.Witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office, which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off Birch Road East, the court was told.Mr Sukul said: "When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present."(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed.The case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other Birmingham councillors in the Bordesley Green ward, claims which are denied.
