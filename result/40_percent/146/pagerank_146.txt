Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded "deeply irresponsible" by the Liberal Democrats.The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK.Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to Â£680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency."The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck."Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK.The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme.In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard.And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.
