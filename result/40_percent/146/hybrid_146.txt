Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded "deeply irresponsible" by the Liberal Democrats.The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a "sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to Â£680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. "This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the Â£48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites.
