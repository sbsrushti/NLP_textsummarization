Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded "deeply irresponsible" by the Liberal Democrats.The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK.But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a "nuclear dumpsite".Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back.Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK.In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a "sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries".Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: "I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times."The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck."
