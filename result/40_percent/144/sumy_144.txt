An MP has had more than Â£600 and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in Kenya.Quentin Davies, the MP for Grantham and Stamford, was attacked in a notoriously dangerous park in the capital, Nairobi.Mr Davies, 60, said the mugging occurred 100 yards from the Nairobi Serena Hotel and equally close to the Anglican Cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk."I knew I had to stay very calm and passive - you cannot fight six men".He had to spend an extra 24 hours in Nairobi before rejoining the rest of the House of Commons International Development Committee in Dafur after the mugging."Naturally, I was afraid they would use a knife or gun, though they never produced any weapon," he said.
