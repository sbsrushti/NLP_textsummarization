The government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says.An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level.Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.Education minister Ivan Lewis said: "We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace."The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year.Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19.The number of these people gaining qualifications was "rising slowly".Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: "This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour's failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life.Get On's participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007.Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis added: "Far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives."When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was "only the start of the journey".
