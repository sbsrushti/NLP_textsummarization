"It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy."In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved.Measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term.Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics.Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school.A Department for Education and Skills source said: "Every day in school counts.A fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly.Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school.
