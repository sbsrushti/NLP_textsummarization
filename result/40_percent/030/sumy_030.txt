A fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly.Parenting contracts, penalty notices and "fast track" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem.Tories say Labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school.In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved.Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's Behaviour Improvement Programme.The new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on Monday.Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school.Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school."It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy."
