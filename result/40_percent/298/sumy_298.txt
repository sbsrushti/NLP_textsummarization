In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it.The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work."While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible," says its report.Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200.The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m.Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: "There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced."Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible."The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.
