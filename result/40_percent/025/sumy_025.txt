A former Home Office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor UK immigration.Barbara Roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government.Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures.Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate.Ms Roche, Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome.She said her proposals mean "we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view."
