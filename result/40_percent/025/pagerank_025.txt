A former Home Office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor UK immigration.She said her proposals mean "we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view."She said this would counter "so-called independent" groups like Migration Watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent.She went on: "What I would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures, published them, and was independent of government.Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate.
