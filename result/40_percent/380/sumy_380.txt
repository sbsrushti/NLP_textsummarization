The minimum wage will rise in October, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.The recommendations came from the Low Pay Commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.A further increase in the adult rate to £5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for October 2006.According to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage "challenging"."We have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact," said chairman Adair Turner.The government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.Unveiling the latest increase, Mr Blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a "symbol of decency and fairness"."For too long, poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families," he said."Too often, people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay."Chancellor Gordon Brown and Transport Secretary Alistair Darling promoted the news in Edinburgh, Wales Secretary Peter Hain and Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan in Cardiff and Northern Ireland Minister John Spellar in Belfast.The government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.A £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last October for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt.The Trade Unions Congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year.But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) called for a "pause year" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in October."What employers are saying to us now is that it's at a level where it's starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country."The Liberal Democrats' economics spokesman Vincent Cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage.Conservative leader Michael Howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not "seek to disturb" the increase.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Mr Howard hinted the Tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers.I got a part time Job at 16 when I was doing my A-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for Uni.We must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.Still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.An easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.However for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage I would simply ask them: "Would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour?".Also I personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you?It's about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn't go a miss either.The minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer.I feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life.Its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.We all remember Michael Howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one!Great keep at it Tony, I remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with.Living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult.Hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.I work at a large Hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate.How dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages?Although I would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks.This is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies.By increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.The extra cost this increase will bring, will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy, which, in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the UK, or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere.The jubilation felt by "low-paid" workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs.Andrew in Derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'.In our degraded democracy, elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority.If my maths is right, a 35 hour week at £5.05 gives you an annual income just over £9,000 and raising it to £6 leaves it under £11,000.We are already seeing a sweeping change in IT work being lost to India where people are paid much less.It is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as 'sweat shop', but now we are told it is global competition.Seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job.If the TUC get their way a very large number of SMEs will have to close - this will put more people out of work.The government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the SMEs but we always get overlooked, they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries, after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies.We are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.While I'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, I am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses.If the rate rises to £6 then I can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.The raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales, it will mean that I will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and I will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff, overtime being the first to go.It is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the "lower status" jobs.I know about this great idea - don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage.I hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that Mr Blair and Mr Brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?I worked hard, went to college part time, got my A-levels and degree & bettered myself.I might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.As a graduate working for minimum wage, I welcome any increase of pay I can get.As an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year.If the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine.Think of us employers as well Mr Blair, we are not all big corporations earning millions.How many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?Students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country.
