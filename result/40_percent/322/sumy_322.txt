The Labour Party received more than £5m in donations in the final quarter of 2004, new figures show.This is nearly half of the £11,724,929 received by 16 political parties listed by the Electoral Commission.Lord Drayson, whose company PowderJect won multi-million pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 September terror attacks, gave £500,000 to the party just days before Christmas.Other significant donations came from retired millionaire businessman and philanthropist Sir Christopher Ondaatje who gave the party a sum of £500,000, and refrigerator magnate William Haughey OBE who gave £330,000.The totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003, as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign.There were also donations topping £250,000 for the Conservatives from Scottish Business Groups Focus on Scotland and the Institute of International Research, the world's largest independent conference company.This company is controlled by the party's former treasurer Lord Ashcroft which has directed almost £300,000 to specific marginal constituencies over the past two years.This was a fee the firm paid for a room for an event held with the work and skills foundation during the party's conference.The UK Independence Party, which lost its main donor Paul Sykes amid the row over Robert Kilroy-Silk's bid for the leadership last autumn, took in £63,081.It is an offence for a person to knowingly or recklessly make a false declaration about party donations.
