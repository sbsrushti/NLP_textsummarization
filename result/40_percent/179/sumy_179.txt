Thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets, many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a Thursday.The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.Anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law.Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, told BBC News: "We've long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do.She said many people did not share the Countryside Alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue.He described the ban as "ridiculous" and "badly thought out" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.At the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, the Countryside Alliance failed in its attempt to have the Hunting Act ruled invalid.The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions.The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules.A spokesman said: "Basically, it's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well."
