Hunts in England and Wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal, with more due out later. The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.But the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits.Anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law. "But if they continue to chase foxes, to chase wild mammals around the countryside, that's against the law and we're confident they'll be brought to justice. He described the ban as "ridiculous" and "badly thought out" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.At the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, the Countryside Alliance failed in its attempt to have the Hunting Act ruled invalid. But it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police. The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions." The decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected.
